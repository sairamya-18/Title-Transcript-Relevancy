f39Fy5jTzfI,fashion trends that are going to be huge,its always fun to see what trends are going to be happening for the next season and in this case the next year and so these are the trends that the fashion world is predicting to be huge in some may surprise you some you may not want to see but this is an idea of what we have to look forward to and lets get started in we saw lots of basics basics were a very big trend we had every single company known to man whether they made basics or not they came out with a white tea basics were huge this year in were going to still see basics but theyre going to be a little bit updated or a little bit elevated a little bit more interesting the tank top was huge in and its still a very big trend for and of course you will see your basic ribed tank top but you also are going to see some tank tops that are glittery or metallic or leather your basic tank top but on steroids ill be honest with you im not sure how how i feel about the that these kinds of tank tops i dont know if ill be into that but maybe i will who knows well see what happens lets talk about just a few jeans and ill probably do a whole separate video on jeans next year for spring but some jeans that are going to be big for the barrel leg its just its not going anywhere anyone who thought it was a flash in the pan trend um its not its still here its still going to go well into will it last forever of course not but it is still a big jean trend for youre also going to see a lot of white jeans and offwhite jeans go into which makes sense because its kind of a micro trend right now but then as we get into spring i cant even believe im talking about spring right now um it was degrees this morning anyway as we get into spring it will be kind of a more traditional type trend so i think were going to see a lot of white jeans and offwhite jeans styled in many different ways and on into heres a big question that everybody wants to know is are skinny jeans going to come back in and listen i dont know the future but i can predict it just based on what i see in the fashion world the thing is the skinny jean that we were wearing like six years ago that are really stretchy that were almost a jegging theyre really tight they were tight all the way down to our to our ankles those just yeah know they they still look kind of dated yes you can play around with them and probably restyle them as i think you can do with all your clothes but as far as wearing them in the exact same ways we were wearing them for so many years its still a kind of a dated look what is a big trend and i think this will be a big trend for are the slim straight jeans which are kind of a cousin to the skinny jean but its a stiffer pair of jeans theyre not super stretchy like the ones we were wearing and they may be fitted on your hips and your thighs but then it has some room at the calf so theyre definitely a skinnier jean but theyre not skin tight but what do i know you never know in the spring it might be flooding our world and everywhere you see skinny jeans and over the knee boots and um floppy hats or something and the s are back it is so much fun to watch which is why i love doing these videos but if i had to predict it i still dont think those skinny jeans from years ago are going to be back in and then of course wide leg straight leg all that is definitely in thats like a big major huge trend thats definitely not going anywhere for a long time lowrise highrise midrise any rise but the wide and straight is definitely the more staple kind of um style jean at the moment now in we are definitely going to see a lot more statement jewelry and just interesting ensembles very unique to your own personal style i did do a jewelry video i will link down in the description box below but if you do like high quality jewelry pieces or youre looking for a really great gift for somebody who does im very excited to share with you the sponsor of this video which is majuri youve definitely seen me wear a lot of maui pieces these are just kind of some of my everyday goto pieces that i put on these earrings im wearing right now are they look like they would be heavy but theyre not they are super lightweight have them in silver and ive worn them so much that i actually got them in gold as well because theyre kind of a statement earring but theyre still theyre not heavy and like cumbersome and i just think theyre so cute cuz sometimes i just want to wear like a big earring and nothing else i do think something like this would be a really great christmas gift for somebody who likes jewelry because theyre still classic enough looking but they still make a statement and theyre very high quality theyre not heavy they go really well with all the highneck sweaters now i have seen a lot of heart jewelry hearts have been a huge trend for for a while but this has been the one that i actually really really like its just subtle enough you could layer it with other things or you could just wear it by itself maui has probably the best ring selection i think of anybody i love their rings all of their rings are very easy to wear by themselves or you can stack them with each other and i also get really funny about wearing really heavy rings on my fingers all day long because they start to bother me but these i wear and then i just kind of forget that i have them on if you do like high quality jewelry karat gold stir lling silver all of majs pieces are sustainably sourced and theyre all made of high quality materials i really dont think you can go wrong with any of these pieces i will link the ones that im showing you here um down below in the description box and great company to check out for christmas gifts this year and lets continue shear has been a big trend for the last couple of years but in i think its going to be bigger than ever lots of clothing houses are really embracing shear in just lots of different styles and ill be honest with you i just got to tell you i do think that you know of these sheer pieces and sheer items they just you know they just they run the risk of just kind of looking cheap and tacky ill just thats thats how i feel i dont know maybe i shouldnt say that this video but there are of them that look beautiful there is one dress its the dress that is basically not sheer all the way down to your thigh and then its got a sheer skirt i think these are so pretty i probably stand alone on that so theres some sheer that i actually really like and usually when something becomes a really big trend it does come out in more styles and it just gets better looking and theres a lot more options to choose from so maybe in six months ill be like i love shear shear is so great if you like shear get ready for it and if youre like me you only like some sheer well maybe therell be some pieces of shear that you actually really like in we are going to see a lot more maximalist fashion in in the last few years weve saw a lot of minimalist fashion and just a lot of basic no frills kinds of styles which i personally kind of love but it is fun to add something thats kind of a statement piece every once in a while so i think thats really going to kick off in the engine is going to start for this more maximalist statement making pieces in the fashion world designers like st laurant and loue they are bringing back some more statement making maxima styles in some of their shows were already seeing this in jewelry where a lot more statement pieces and like just you know big bigg ger more statement making jewelry pieces are kind of becoming these standouts in the jewelry world so i think this is really going to continue through itll be fun to see where this goes and itll really be fun to see where fashion goes with this being a trend in we are going to see more of the boho look become a thing and when was it that boho was so big i dont know why im drawing a blank on this comment below when it was so big was it the s you know what maybe it was the s maybe it was both in any case youre going to see a lot more boho styles this will be a really fun one to look at when spring comes around in fall weve seen a lot of these big hobo bags which is definitely more of kind of like the boho style become really big but we will definitely see more boho styles going into and suede has been a huge trend suede is definitely going to continue to be a huge trend in even in spring we saw a lot of this from chloe in these beautiful feminine suede pieces for spring paired with very feminine skirts and very feminine boho ensembles suede will be so big in and even in spring youre going to see suede loafers sued skirts and so many styles in the suede and faux suede fabric this is of course just a continuation of the big suede trend thats happening right now and theres one suede item the suede midi skirt that i just think is so cute every time i see it on somebody im like oh my god i love that look love it with boots i think its so cute sports wear and active wear has kind of been blurring its definition for quite some time and in we saw a kind of a microt trend of the adidas pants with a button down and some loafers or ballet flats or something and in were going to see more of these sportswear athletic wear type styles but they kind of look a little more fashiony they dont look like you would just wear them to go work out or play rugby because you know were all playing rugby over here um it be something you wear with your pearls and then you wear as your outfit i love the big rugby stripe thats been on trend for a while i have one rugby stripe shirt i had to reel myself back in from buying like a total slew of them its like i just need one but i love that look and so i do kind of see i kind of see myself kind of being into this its a fun casual trend i can kind of see this being a a really fun trend for us to play around with in youll have to let me know what you think along with this sporty chic trend i am expecting to see a lot more polo shirts in womens fashion in so we have seen a rise in the trend of polo shirts in and were just going to see a lot more styles and cuts of polo shirts instead of it just being the boxy kind of oversized relaxed polo shirts we might see some that maybe are a little bit more of a feminine little bit body skimming of a cut so im not personally into the body skimming fitted cuts and i dont really even think thatll be the big trend i think itll still be more like the relaxed look i do think we will see different variations of the polo shirt become really big for shoulders are going to be trending for i know that sounds strange and i dont mean cold shoulder tops theyre still not trending not even for but the offsh shoulder strapless the one shoulder the asymmetrical all those styles will be really big for and of course were coming up on spring were not really coming up on spring the first major season in if we dont really count winter is spring and so you know you will see a lot of strapless dresses and a lot of you know one shoulder asymmetrical even right now in fall and winter we are seeing a lot of sweaters and knits that are offsh shoulder so i think this will be a fun one for if you like those styles i do love the off shoulder and the one shoulder i think that can be a really fun way to show a little bit of skin but youre not just like showing everything so well have to see where that goes these are two trends that have been huge for and i think even and theyre just going to still be huge in its just one of those really big trends that last many many years and one is the ladylike jacket or the tweed jacket the chanel inspired jacket thats really been a big trend the last couple of years and its just going to continue into and then the other trend that is going to continue into are the cardigans and im talking about like the more boxy de cardigans andor the ones that are already button well kind of like the one i have on but i guess this isnt really a cardigan and but that whole style is still very big cropped or really long either way but that has just been a really big trend for itll be into im sure you probably already have one of these something like it because it is so popular but i dont see that going anywhere for so those were some major trends happening for that we can expect to see youll have to let me know what you think i will of course do some more videos as we get more into and on specific categories theres so much fun to watch i just love to see what happens in the fashion world and some trends i love and some trends i dont so you know dont ever feel obligated to wear something just because its trending anyway let me know what you think as always let me know what you like or dont like um make sure to check out maui especially if youre still looking for gifts for those people who are a little bit hard to buy for i feel like they have some really great pieces that would be really beautiful christmas gifts anyway i will link everything um that i talk about or mentioned in the video in the description box below and i will see you next time
66Vfm5MZYKw,golden globes fashion roast the good the bad and the ugly,hello everybody my name is lukar and this is hotl mode and today on hot mode were getting into the golden globes fashion roast were going to be talking about a bunch of celebrity outfits from the most recent golden globes where movies and tv come together for one night now listen theres a lot of people to talk about so if you dont see your fave here in this video theres going to be another one where youll see them there is a lot of people i couldnt have like a person plus vid so dont get your undies in a twist without further ado lets begin first up ali wong i have to stop myself from saying ali wrong every time just dont understand the choices we make shes wearing balenciaga okure and i understand that it was meant to be like a fun strippy chiffon dress with a big bow its just it looks like you went through the shredder and the thing is i can appreciate artistic techniques and capabilities and crafts ship i just also at the same time like we have to say what things look like and it looks like she got torn up not just by me but by somebody before me i just think that when i saw it on the runway i thought okay not for me and if the models cant pull it off its very rare than anybody else can this is one of those cases the bow with the waist i dont love the curved neckline im not obsessed with i just think its a lot of dress with the gloves it doesnt help it takes it out of it its just too much and you really have to be able to carry it and unfortunately i dont think theres anybody that could carry something like this next up we have angelina jolie who is wearing alexander mcqueen this is from the most recent collection and its actually the finale look from that collection so ive been kind of waiting to see who is going to wear it and my issue with the dress is i didnt love it on the runway like wasnt my favorite i wasnt as oded by it i think as a lot of other people were but i could appreciate a cool part of the dress which is it this sort of hood i dont know if it was kind of like a veil that just sat over top and then draped over and it all looked like it was one piece but it was like a full look it just had this aura from like head to toe because of this veil shroud and angelina jolie didnt wear the veil shroud she just wore her hair and her face which is okay but like i think this dress needed the shroud it was based on the alexander mcqueen collection banshees based on like the irish mythology of the screaming banshee its a really cool concept i just like the wispy sort of dark gothic eerie silvery ghostin that you would think of like when you think of a banshee i dont think we have it here it just feels like mother of the bride silver dress and like thats great for some people but like i expect more especially when its mcqueen so i just wish that angelina jolie like had let herself get into the veil or even if they did a custom veil where it would still show her face in some manner or degree but it kept that idea of wrapping the head the sort of like shrieking shacky glamour i think its hard to deconstruct certain looks and then put it on the red carpet and say well im just going to do like casual glam and its like i dont know if youre keeping the energy of the dress and then i also just dont think the shoes help defeat the mother of the bride accusations either next up we have anna aai and shes wearing dior and heres the thing i did see that she was saying how she wanted to be inspired by her character on shogun and this idea of sort of like i believe armor and this tightness at the bodice and then a sort of flowiness from the skirt and like thats great and thats good and i dont actually mind the bodice i think the bodice is interesting its different for dior its not really something that i would expect to see but i do actually feel like when i think about it its based on that resort collection and this idea of like armor and scotland and things like that its just been done in full white i just dont think the skirt supports the dress the way that i think it should be supported i understand wanting to go for like a column effect b is having this peplum in it it just doesnt land as like super glamorous anybody that was like oh yeah its different emotion it doesnt look that different emotion to me i just i dont think the skirt supports it and then on top of it the back is all buckles so it it does expose the back and its buckling i just dont think its a good dress skirt separate combo i think shes radiant like that goes without saying with everybody its just i dont love the skirt and also with dior i do expect a little bit better better in terms of quality i expect a little boring sure fine but i also do usually expect a lot more crispness clean its very very very very well done and so im a little shocked by this next up we have ariana grande now she is wearing vintage xoni by uber xoni himself from spring summer shes old shes an old girl not ariana im talking about the dress please heres what ill say about the dress i dont know if they give them the background color scheme beforehand orh hand but like i just dont think that wearing this yellow with that background helps i just think that the pale yellow with the pale flowers in yellow it doesnt land and i think that it takes away from the dress i understand wearing yellow why shes been wearing yellow cuz like theres a glinda reference or something like that but i think that this is very uber deoni design wise if you look at the skirt we can see that its sort of an empire waistline and then it gathers the actual waste and sort of bubbles out i dont think that its a particularly attractive design quality but it is also very much so an uber deoni thing like if we look at older styles its very bubble pokes out its what he did i didnt love it i do know that she was obviously trying to pay omage to audrey heern because she loves audrey heern and also shes been a xoni brand ambassador in the past i stand it i just think that it wasnt my favorite dress to do it with the necklace and the jewelry and even the gloves like i think that shes adding a character to it i think the styling is very well done i will say the embroidery if we zoom in is beautiful theres this gold that sort of outlines all of the pearlescent little orbs or whatever they are whatever the design is and it is really radiant i also think its important to note that the swooping sort of side skirt again another xoni ism so like it is a real xoni okure from way back in the day so if you appreciate that thats wonderful i can also appreciate that i just think the dress in this context im not obsessed with it but besides that i feel like everybodys saying shes angling for an audrey heer biopic id give it to her who am i to say no next up we have iowa debor and she is wearing l i loved the thing is its a pretty unassuming suit really beautifully cut honestly blazer i like the gray shirt underneath and then you have a pair of intriguing pants theyre draped and funny enough if you look at the back of your pants or certain jeans usually have that sort of emblem on the back it could say levis it could say lou it could say whatever but it seems like with jonathan anderson hes turned it to the front and in reality draped so that right underneath this sort of leather patch that says l thats where the drape ends creates this interesting sort of pleated not pleated but really gathered pair of trousers and changes idea of tailoring its really intriguing but the most fun part about the whole look is the fact that shes wearing a gold feather tie i love it its so weird and quirky and cool and crazy but its so much fun now i also saw online i believe its the cino came out and said that julia roberts actually was possibly a reference for io and its this gray suit that she wore to the golden globes so i kind of love the fact that if this is true its like not only a cool play and nod to you know actors of the past but at the same time totally switches the concept up by adding in this gold feather tie so i just love thought it was fun like its such a simple way to change a suit and make it just a little bit funkier without really taking away the idea of a wellcut suit next up we have celan cette and she is wearing louis vuitton i love this dress heres the thing about it its very nickolas jare for louis vuitton it just sort of has this weirdness yet at the same time i mean the skirt fits phenomenally and then you have this interesting sort of draping situation going on in this bloused bodice area its this idea of embracing like a wider shoulder yet not making it feel super heavy or super tailored or super s i also just think its really interesting to see the liquidity of the draping but also this dress is not gold i would say in terms of fabric you know what i mean like were thinking maybe oh this is a lame its a gold lame no if we zoom in we can actually see that the gold of this dress is made because it is entirely embroidered in bugle beads think about that like somebody had to hand embroider the fabric so that it had these beads on it like this is a fully hand embroidered gown and then on top of it you have these crystals that are added in at the very top to sort of give a little bit of sparkle and its not really my favorite part of the dress i think the gold on its own would be fine but some people were like we like the crystals so okay sure whatever do your thing i would do with but it doesnt hurt the dress the other interesting fact toid is c blan chad actually wore this dress already and she wore it to the can film festival back in the thing is i believe that lvie must have readded or revamped the dress because when we look at the original version it does not have the crystals up top but im sure that back in somebody will probably find the clip that i was complaining about the way that the drape sort of sat but i do actually think now looking at the older version with the crystals the crystals actually help sort of take you out of looking at the seam that then adds in the gathering i actually think that this is a much better version it really sort of helps you to really focus on this idea of the liquidity of movement the so i love that c blette loves to rewear her stuff and also that its really just been like upcycled you know what i mean its not just the exact same dress its had a little bit of sparkle added to it to make it new next up weve coleman domingo whos wearing valentino hes been a heavy valentino gentleman as of late although i think maybe last year the golden gloves who wore a valentino and that was like i think my favorite col and domingo look ever heres the thing on this its like a beautiful black suit hes so statuesque and radiant that he always looks good in everything even when i dont love everything i think what my maybe big issue here is is that the shirting area i love the polka dot i love the white and the black and i love that its really just white and black white and black white and black throughout most i love the tie i think whats hard is the tie is so big and then the fringe layers on top of the second part of this bow experience that it kind of clunks up that area especially with a cumr bun underneath you know what i mean so like you dont really see much of the polka dot so like its a lot of graphic graphic graphic and then it goes to all black and i think thats my one singular issue with it he looks great like the suit fits him fantastically and im happy to see that and i like again that he always is out there in a little bit fashion for forward not a little bit a lot of bit fashion forward hes much more fashion forward than most of the people we talk about i appreciate it its just i think maybe this is my one thing that im like i dont love it but i appreciate it im happy with it next up we have cynthia arivo shes wearing louis vuitton i love this dress i really do and i know people be like luke how can you love this dress like its a weird gigantic peplum thats squared but heres the thing that im going to say we when we look at a lot of dresses throughout this carpet in particular the way that they hit the floor is kind of strange like they just sort of hit and chop right at the floor and it feels awkward look at the way that this skirt falls like it is beautiful its perfect its a gorgeous skirt just for the skirt alone it would be approved im obsessed i would die for it but i also just think that a the actual bodice of the dress fits her rather well somebody commented and they were like fits perfectly actually the boobs are smushed yeah i can see what were saying about the was being a little smushed i get that i understand that but besides that i mean the waist fantastic and then you have this peplum and cynthia is always a little bit again a vard a little fashion forward its something thats different but i actually dont think that this from a fashion perspective hurts the silhouette of the dress it does not take away anything yes its an additive that might make some people uncomfortable but i cannot in good conscience sit here and say oh this hurts the dress this creates way too much space at the waist area oh this really detracts from the skirt or from the top no i actually think that its kind of perfect and i dont know if its because of the way that it lays i dont know if its because its pretty much a rectangle but at the same time its like a fabric rectangle that we can only see from this you know d surface but in reality if we look at it from the side its probably an arch on the sides its just a really fascinating dress and i love the fact that cynthia is making me think so so much about something and then on top of it i think that the black and silver its not really a lace but in my brain from afar it looks like a lace its actually a black matte fabric that is fully sequined so it looks like a lace it makes your eye think its a lace so its like kind of like lace trump ly a little bit from a distance the pum is a lace i lied its just covered in silver sequins but the rest of the dress is not and i love the fact that the pum is lace but the rest of the dress isnt and you cant really tell that from just looking at it and again like really very well done her and her silus jason balden like i just they i dont know how they do it its like a zenda la roach thing they just time after time deliver next up we have demi moore shes wearing armani pr now i said in one of my other videos one of the instagram tik tok videos that i didnt like love the dress i dont think its a bad dress im not saying its a bad dress beautiful color i love organza its not as reflective organza i think maybe just in this photo to me i cant tell if thats an overlay cant tell if thats water that they put on the dress and its just reflecting off its strange but i love it i think the neckline is interesting i like the silver crystals that move through and sort of create this interesting shape like i i dont think its a bad dress i dont think she looks bad i think she looks beautiful and its a dress of some interest i just am not as gagged about this dress as i am about other peoples dresses and i think thats okay next up is l fanning who is wearing bal man now this is a custom balman gown by olivier rone but its actually based on a balman okure look from the fall winter collection we can see that there are actually leopard panels at the bust area but then we can see that it has that sort of draped bodice the belt and then big skirt now the thing that i love about the recreation of this dress is the fact that with ls its very very similar in terms of leopard drape big skirt bel but unlike the original im assuming that they did not use like real leopard i assume they use some sort of fur that they then painted or you know colored to look like leopard ells isnt real leopard thank goodness its actually embroidered with bugle beads like capelan chets and so im pretty positive that the only leopard print is through the embroidery so thats how theyve done it and like i think thats fantastic this isnt even normally a dress i would be into i mean it has a skinny belt it is sort of poofy and beige and the leopard maybe doesnt necessarily make a lot of sense to me but i actually do think that it really works i think the skirt is lovely i think the color is fantastic on her and i think that that leopard embellishment really just adds a little oomph a little intrigue a little interest to make it just feel different on top of it shes wearing cardier now the cardier like brand animal is the panther her necklace is two panthers with spots that sort of you know come to a head right at the front of her neck and so its just like again another fun way to play into brand imagery cardier and b and like its just i dont know its cool i think its all well thought out next up we have glenn powell who is wearing georgo armani and heres the thing like its a good suit it fits him well i just dont really get wearing a cber bun and then also like not wearing a bow tie with like a tuxedo situation you know what i mean like i think thats what im not comprehending i get that hes meant to be like hot sexy guy on campus kind of thing i see it i understand it hes hot hes sexy cool but wish that there was like a tie i think that like popping the buttons and then wearing a cumber bun is like casual but dressed up and it doesnt work here i think that you kind of have to pick one you cant have both you cant have your cake and eat it too next up we have jonathan vaness were in christian serano i didnt even know that this was christian serano when i first was talking about this jvn dress in other realms but it makes it so much worse i am not upset about jonathan vaness wearing a dress nor wearing makeup cuz somebody was like thank god somebodys saying we shouldnt have men wearing dresses and makeup and i was like no no no thats not the point im making wear a dress wear makeup just dont wear like an ugly dress or do bad makeup thats my issue i think its a piece of fabric and the piece of fabric should be worn by whoever wants to wear it just wear it well or at least wear a piece of fabric that looks well its just the side strap ruffle thing the bodice does nothing for no body weirdly made i dont really comprehend it the seamor the gathering the draping not even like two shoulders to maybe even things out i feel like there are better christian serano looks that we could have gone for you know what i mean like i am advocating on behalf of christian sano i know that theres better things that exist this one is strange to me this is a very strange weird pick speaking of weird pics carrie washington wearing balenciaga and heres the thing i know that weve seen this dress on like nicole kidman cuz she wore this i think during the balenciaga show or some celebrity wore this i think it was nicole i just dont understand like the neon pink drape gown i just i dont think it works i just feel its heavy yet i dont think its supposed to feel heavy i think that the way that it comes up on the neck is also strange like it kind of eats away this part of the neck and so you lose that ability to sort of raise your neck and be taller because the dress goes so high up and so i think its a strange pick like i could get into the other parts of it being draped and violently neon pink i guess but i also think with the gloves and the shoes like i understand thats the balenciaga styling i understand thats what we do i just dont get why we chose this theres a lot of balenciaga on the carpet and like i know people dont like balenciaga thats fine i just dont comprehend why we didnt go more heavily into like the balenciaga oat couture of yester year stuff and rather we stuck with the more sort of experimental stuff that clearly like the mainstream audience doesnt love as much i just i im not understanding next up we have margaret qualey and shes wearing chanel and i think this is really lovely which i feel like i dont get to say about chanel a lot im hoping that i get to say a lot of that in the future with mat blazi going there but this is really sweet like chanel studio team i see you i respect you i appreciate you its just a lovely white dress if we look up close you can see the beautiful silver flashes of stars and things like that which was like a coco chanel signature she loved five started stars because she was a leo born in the fifth month she had like a big thing about number five she know number five so i get that i also love if you really really look up close on the sides right at where her bicep is you can see that these are little tear of chiffon like super super light chiffon and that i actually think is rather lovely i dont even mind the bow that much cuz i do think that its just one singular black bow that helps to sort of create a waste and at the same time doesnt try to interfere with anything else going on in the dress and then as we move down the front of the dress its just nice tears again its a real chanel signature if you look at stuff from the s and s thats what a lot of early chanel looks like and so i dont mind seeing those kinds of styles i just think that it has to be done properly and this feels like its done properly like she looks radiant and beautiful and im happy to finally get to say that and to see it and people say im mean and cruel i am its just i can be nice too next up we have mdty mat and i just wanted to talk about this cuz like its fun its nice its cool i love this white suit i love the squiggles i know that it has a particular name whoever is going to tell me the name i appreciate you but these squiggles i believe its like a western influence and i just think that theyre nice sort of piping on the lapels and the sleeves i love the little bolo tie the shoes are great the star shoes like its just fun like we can do fun suiting lets try it next up we have mikey madison in bga vena now this is a matu blazi designed bga vena so i heard this is a lend this is a rumor i dont know if this is true or not but this is apparently the last custom look that well see from mat at bga so we got to cherish it while we can and in reality its very metu cuz the man loves a fish loves a scale and so this is all enamel sequins that create this fish scale experience and i have to say i think as far as his bga custom and like red carpet stuff this is pretty good it was a little helter skelter certain points wasnt always great so i like the idea of seeing this happen like it fits well it works the enamel you know it allows the texture to do the work which is very bga and very mat its really about like the staples the foundation and i think that that here is nice she looks really lovely i think the gold works on her do i wish it was maybe a little higher up possibly but besides that i think its good next up we have nikki glazer and shes wearing prob gung and everybody was mad at me or is mad at me because i dont love this dress im sorry i saw a couple of the other looks that nikki glazer woree throughout the award show and i thought those were a lot better i just dont think that this color is great in this moment i think maybe its the backdrop i think its also just like it being in a silk i like the silhouette you know i like the sort of builtin fake circular train situation it just doesnt look as refined as it could i think its really the color is the actual problem its a tough fabric i think to really sell i think from the waist up its good i just think that the skirt isnt really amazing its fine but again not amazing i liked a lot of the other stuff that she wore but i just feel like this color is really really hard to pull off next up we have timothy shalam and he is wearing tom ford now this apparently is the first hder acrian designed piece that were seeing for tom ford hyder acman was appointed at tom ford and i love this little glitter suit its a black suit and from afar maybe it doesnt look super interesting but if we zoom in we can see that theyre a little specks of glitter i assume theyre sequins of some sort that are just flecked around and it feels like a nice piece of wrapping paper and im into it the shirt underneath totally fine i dont mind it at all i actually think its striped the scarf i thought it was an odd choice people were saying that it was a bob dylan reference but i dont know if it actually is like if it is thats fine and i know hes doing a lot of bob dylan method dressing stuff and i appreciate timmy going for things and being fun and you know risky but i was trying to look a little bit to see if i could find stuff like that somebody said it was something that he wore on stage but what i also saw online is that mario bod posted a picture of hater rman wearing a scarf in the exact same manner like tying it like that and timothy shanam and hater arran are like very good friends like really really good buddies so i think maybe its a bob dyan reference but i also think its definitely a hater acrian reference i like to see it i wish the pants fit a little bit differently but i feel like thats him he always does that its just like his signature thing but besides all of that i actually really love the suit i can get used to the tie and i feel like hes been having fun with fashions next up we have viola davis who is wearing gucci i love to see it i didnt even know that this was gucci i think that its lovely the black fits her wonderfully the dress its opaque its gorgeous its stunning its easy but the thing thats really fun about it and i feel like viola loves color and she likes to color block is this pleated cape in the back actually has like strips of i dont know if theyre sequins i think that theyre st strips of metallic fabric that its blue and its green and its pink and theres also some at the bottom of the dress too theres yellows and all that its just like a fun disco party movement color rainbow experience like it its nice and i like the fact that its against the black backdrop of the actual black sequin gown and the cape i just think it adds a little fun which is what i think sab disaro at gucci needs great product makes beautiful things its just we need a little bit more of the fun a little bit more of the excitement and i think this is like a good way of him doing that really subtle version of that and also keeping his brand idea of gucci you know front forward and facing so i think she looks great next up we have zena wearing custom louis vuon and bulgary a beautiful gorgeous necklace i mean without a doubt you cant say that shes not stunning like shes just a beautiful human being like stunning so as for this gown its a pretty simple strapless column dress that has a builtin sort of bustle skirt train in the back and its in this really lovely rusty orange which is something that i feel like i dont see her in all that often but when we pair it with the hair that she did i think it really plays super duper well together then on top of it you have again this bulgary necklace its like a little lightish bluish green turquoisey with the silver just s but what i also love about the dress is the fact that its a reference or a play and a nod to the designer zelda win valdez who was a new york based designer and she actually made the very iconic playboy bunny uniforms but also made a lot of other clothes besides that but thats one of her more notable contributions but often times when we talk about american fashion designers zelda wi valz is like not added into the equation shes like one of the forgotten designers but what also was an inspiration to zena and la roach for this look is joyce bryant the singer and the fact that zelda and valdez made dresses for joyce bryant so theres a couple that you can see what they were kind of going for in terms of that column dress but what i also found interesting was its not exactly the dress because you cant really find like a specific zelda wi valdez reference for the dress but there is pictures of joyce bryant wearing similar silhouette in terms of the column dress and then having side panels that dont go all the way around but in reality i think thats probably where they started and then slowly but surely built out this beautiful look with louis vuitton and nasier to create this homage that also was very much so of its own just think that she looks fantastic what i will say is my only true issue with the dress is right below where the corset is we can see that there are seams running right down the front theres wrinkling there and thats i assume because the corset fits super duper well and then theres a little bit of excess fabric in order i think for her to be able to move but again the thing about zenai thats really really smart and you know im giving a little bit of difference to her that i wouldnt give to other people yes i agree but she always understands how to style and fix herself she wasnt on the carpet with her stylus but at one point you can see a video where zena is pushing down the fabric so that its not wrinkling cuz she has understood that the dress will do that and then on top of it theres just pictures where she covers that area with their hand so like this is what i say what im talking about you need to sell the garment like you cannot just expect the dress the suit the whatever to do all of the work you have to also be a part of that process of wearing it and understanding if there is a flaw if there is something that does not necessarily work or wont photograph well your job is to make sure that you minimize that and so i think this is a really good example for celebrities upand cominging celebrities is like you got to be a part of the process its not all just done for you you have to understand how the clothes are going to work and what will and wont work and how to play that down and so this i thought was a really interesting take but besides that everything else about this including the matching shoe is just utterly perfect our last person of this video cuz well have another video i promise zoe sana in cerol its a sequin dress strapless in im going to say its like a really dark brown it doesnt feel like a black to me but i think thats also because the silk sort of shawl train that shes wearing is in a chocolatey brown i dont mind it i think its a little simple but also i feel like ive seen zoe in like evening gown things that i just dont understand and so this is well done quality looks nice everything works together even the way that the necklace sort of slowly but surely moves down and theres a subtle little plunge there like thats what i want thats fine im im taking this im happy with this good nice looking things if thats all im going to get okay all right so lets talk about best and worst for part one worst im going to give ali wong carrie washington jonathan vaness im going to give glen powell nikki glazer you know what im going to put angelina in there not because the dress is bad its just it was misguided to not play into the character so thats why im putting her there okay as for best im going to give it to matd im going to put margaret quy im going to put cynthia arivo and i dont care what anybody thinks i love it im going to put viola davis in there c blan chat and zanda seems good to me thank you so much for watching i hope you guys enjoyed stick around for part two should be coming shortly hopefully ill see you guys in the next one so tt y l

but were not talking about buttholes we are talking about season rupauls drag race first runway and it is mask for mask so lets get to the tooting and the booting oh there is a butthole lydia butthole thats somebodys name name is l butthole butle lets bring it on lets bring on our first butthole tonight hey everyones got one everyones got one not everyone lets bring on our first butthole category is mask for mask singer first we bring to the stage acaca forgot snow to ho okay a ho man do you want to build a snowman i want to build a h man snowman i want a home man okay its cute its cute its like you did the job you done did it you done did it its cute but i like the reveal i thought that was that was fun you do snowman and then a ral three balls without the three balls she would just look like um sean ooh mask for mask hey but you know its i i i dont care for the frown why not give it a smiley face its a snowman its you know well maybe shes a little goth i dont know who these people are im just im just seeing for the first time but um its a weird first impression but its not a bad one i definitely would have done this differently i i love the idea of uh snowman i think that is one that you can totally elevate its a tobe yes its a tobe next we bring to the stage joella um its okay yeah its okay and heres the thing its not like it doesnt read mask mhm it it looks like shes just wearing shes holding um a paper plate paper plate with some you know decorations on it in front of her face and they okay let me take it off this is what i do when i when i want to be mysterious at a buffet you know i hold the plate in front of my face and then chear out of it like and then fill it up im uncomfortable looking at it i think the the bodyit with all the things is fine actually cuz that kind of it kind of gives me a certain fashion concept but then its just kind of got these weird accessories and then the cape is a little flimsy and it looks look like their feet are about to bust out of them them tiny straps like i feel like i just need something more from it and and i want mask i think the most clever way to wear a mask is not to hold it in front of your face like this um honestly the hair you dont like it its so contrived its very predictable and i know were going to see more of it im not im not insulting the person who made the wig cuz i really give it up to all wig maker people but im just saying this is season this is the first time the world is seeing you and its like okay there there it is again all right now its a boot its a boot next we bring to the stage jewel sparkles she didnt even take the mask off yet okay oh my god and shes so cute out of drag too i live now this dress weve seen several several several many times over the season especially after ariana wore it on the red carpet and the the mask she walked out and shes wearing the mask its on her head then she pulls it off and that beautiful hair valley of the dolls and then the makeup is beautiful the mask is my favorite you know i love putting on my head more than anybody else i love to wear things around my eyes and this is so beautiful and well done i love the color combination all of the gorgeous texture thats on her corset its in her gloves its on the mask the ruffles she just looks complete whats her name again jules sparkles jewel sparkles je sparkles is sparkling its gorgeous she lives up to her name well and you know the thing that with this youve seen other cleen try and do when theyre trying to do a mask like this those frills arent quite sticking up and the way this skirt is done and its mirr to act like thats attention to detail instead of just being a mask thrown on top of something say oh look ive got a mask this is beautiful mhm and that shoe match everything matches oh toot toot next we bring to the stage arti oh its so well done its complete and nothing is is you know you know the skirt fetish that i have and that that that trumpet skirt is a very particular wellmade trumpet skirt cuz some just put a little bell at the bottom but that is gorgeous the hips that the whole thing all the ruffles that come up over the shoulder that

TnNv7Zvui6E,wardrobe essentials explained in minutes,wardrobe essentials are the building blocks to a persons style and with so many essentials out there i feel like its so hard to know which ones will actually work with each other and also what do these individual pieces do for your wardrobe and so today im going to break down the most popular essentials and explain what they pair best with and the reason im talking so fast is because im going to do it all in this many minutes so that you can start building a good foundation for your wardrobe the only wardrobe that matters because outside of your reality nothing is real theres no proof that youre not the only one existing right now and then everything else is just you experiencing yourself i am probably not real oh this video is going to suck but it is what it is so anyways lets explain the first piece in your visual plane which is your top okay lets start with a tshirt probably the most important basic piece of clothing ever this is the goat piece of clothing but the most important part around this piece is the fit as is everything but since theres not too much deviation to this piece other than the shape that should really be the focus for you when it comes to tshirts regular just standard fitting tshirts are good for anchoring neutrality in your wardrobe oversized shirts have been a modern favorite and go well with a lot of styles theres also a lot more leeway on fit as this is intended to be big on you which is a very subjective matter and i think these pair well with other oversized or baggy pieces next we got cropped shirts which i feel are usurping the crown as people start to play with silhouettes and proportions its great for creating separation from your top and and your bottom and now the idea of a graphic or vintage tea if you even want to consider that essential right this is all taste as well i say focus on fitment first because good fitment with a boring graphic is better than bad fitment with a cool graphic cuz like with the latter i feel like you just look a little childish it gets a little sloppy how you doing over there hows your simulation going remember everything youre going through that was your decision this is your simulation slim and form fitting shirts are very relative to your body composition i think theyre a good way at showing off the canvas of the artwork you know what i mean and if you cared enough to get your body to a position where you can show it off through clothing you might as well do your due diligence and get clothes that fit dumbass the next is hoodies and crew necks these are usually more relaxed on the fit as you want these to fit somewhat comfortable a super fitted hoodie is kind of weird considering the purpose of the hoodie in your wardrobe is comfort and also how i feel like weve gone around every single piece of clothings fit trend whatever am i tripping or has there never been a time where fitted hoodies was the thing and and like i just cant even see it going there unless we bring it there unless if anyones going to bring it there its you i usually opt for boxier fitted hoodies nowadays and i still really like a good just cozy oversized hoodie i feel like its really easy to play with and you can actually just wear it but you also dont want to be drowning in your hoodies and a lot of that comes with length so i feel like that is really where you have to pay attention to mostly when it comes to the fitment of your hoodies ive noticed also oh heres some real gas that i just like realized recently but ive noticed playing with color with your hoodie is very effective as its a lot of fabric right theres a lot of visual real estate here on your outfit so if you have a decent understanding of color theory you can get some insane visual play when it comes to your hoodie and if you dont know anything about color theory man i dont think theres ever been a video on color theory ever out there on fashion i dont think there has i man dude how come no ones made a single video on color the okay here is color theory explained in this many seconds this is the color wheel complimentary colors are contrasting colors on opposite ends of this analogous colors are adjacent to each other these are the definitions of complimentary and analogous and visually we find contrast very satisfying this is a good guide to get there how fast was that how fast was that i think that might have been the first video ever on color theat anyways color play with hoodies and crew neck is very effective to such little effort im telling you people love that sh and for the of you that wear clothes for admiration and attention i bet none of you guys do that dude anyways heres a life hack cool colored hoodies are the ultimate form of peacocking without being annoying the effectiveness to annoying level is just goated cuz how can you get mad at someone for wearing a nice colored hoodie that they like and youre just like thats a nice hoodie but you cant even be mad at them cuz its just a nice colored hoodie trust me people love that i but i bet none of you guys we clothes for attention and admiration to look good i bet you guys just wear clothes because i like the closeth shut the up how you doing over there anyways rewards for no effort right isnt that the whole game thats the whole game if this was a flavor of diet soda this they say theres no free lunch this is free lunch but sadly a lot of people dont like diet soda for whatever reason its free but luckily for you this exact feeling also comes in the form of an app thanks to the sponsor of this video rocket which i have been using for years now before they even hit me up to do any integrations this was way before youtube actually that i was still in

the portal click a partner that you like and just buy something go to nike and buy socks and that is a qualifying purchase bam straight to your account so go sign up now everything is in the description and just get your free dude all right were going to move on to a more difficult stage of the game which is pants i feel like people need more guidance here than they think because i feel like a lot of the results come from nuance so let me break some down for you very concise very effective very fast lets start with jeans straight fit is a classic it goes with almost everything think levis this stuff right just your basic pants for this you can really plug and play for almost all colors washes and materials it is very inoffensive and it usually works out because of how neutral it is i highly recommend starting here and getting it right on your body as a true fundamental and again like the hoodies and the shirts pay attention to the length man thats usually so big usually when pants fit too big youll be surprise of how many times its just you just have in on that that you dont need but this goes with oversized and slim pieces is again as its very neutral this sets a baseline and the same goes for shoes pay attention to the length brother just pay attention to the length this is a jack of all trades master of none type of gene but this is kind of where the layup results end with pants everything moving forward is just more contextual to your body type and styling which can really create endless variables you know this can all this can all just get so complicated for no reason its just like one thing changes right and then all of a sudden everything doesnt feel right and even though we got measurements i feel like the whole game of fashion is not really metrized so then cuz like how do you even metrize style right so then the really the only thing you can do when it comes to figuring out why you dont look good and why you do look good and why you want to and and how all you can really do is guess and check which can really just be this endless trial and error cycle and sometimes to no avail to the point where youre overthinking thinking like wow im selfreflecting on the idea that maybe its not the clothes and im the problem the whole time because the wellest common denominator for all these pants is me and the fact that i dont look good at all these pants but all these people look good at pants maybe im the f problem what if im just not supposed to look good in clothes right and im just hardcoded to stay at a specific perceived drip rating like what if the simulation is real and this is just the position im supposed to be in see my fashion elo right im hard stuck like i wish i just look good in pants am i hard stuck in am i hard stuck in silver for fashion can you be carried by your clothes you could totally you could totally be carried by your clothes but you could also be brought down by your clothes why are my teammates soing all the time are we even playing the same game anymore are we evening i hate my position in the simulation i am the simulation brother youre not you you watching this you are actually just part of the simulation im the actual main person character anyways anyways in simple terms what is pants because this is a very simple video it is an easy to watch simple video no complex clothes theory okay no more crashing out randomly in the middle of the video shut up okay so rule of thumb big pants work with big clothes slim pants work with slim clothes visually these pairings are known to work again im trying to simplify it obviously people are going i like wearing big pants with small top i like wearing small pants with i get it bro we get it you know more than me im just making it simple just creating an easy template if you have the bodily frame to create interesting visual dynamics i think big pants small top is a flattering combo again and here we go for length just for pants do not be afraid to hem a few inches off of your pants its the difference between you never wearing them and you wearing them every day trust me man trust me for sneakers i think it looks really good when pants fall on the shoe if you like a crop look thats also fine i love crop pants but just know that you dont need as much crop as you think thats a good rule of thumb nuance goes a long way when it comes to crop but being too heavyhanded with it just looks so silly for boots normally i would like to have some space off the floor for the pants to show off the boots just a bit but its also not a bad look to have your pants kind of go over the boot as well just season this to taste color wash and material i feel like for jeans a little bit of fading goes a long way the more solid and pronounced the color is the more i feel like you have to pay attention to the fit and the silhouette as a more solid color creates a more defined shape which could be very interesting if youre trying to put an emphasis on the shape of your pants and how it works with the rest of your fit but again this is an essentials video so for general wardrobe essentials you kind of want something that is neutral enough that you can just randomly fit with a lot of the other pieces in your wardrobe and i feel like fading and texture fuses the piece just a bit making it easier to casually pair so keep that in mind just a good random back pocket thought for black and blue ive noticed different washes complement different skin tones i have a tanner slightly more orange hue to my skin so ive noticed a medium blue like this just works really well with me and slightly faded black i feel like you cant really go wrong with anybody wardrobe essentials are just a good way to see what you like without over complicating things so dont over complicate it hope this helps

pickups so these next pair of pants we have from minimal la these are actually crazy as bro like im pretty sure a lot of yall who follow my instagram have already seen these pants because they have this back uh like this uh zipper back and im not even going to hold yall i aint unzipping that we going to ride like no diddy twin im just going to keep it like that twin no diddy over here besides that though um the zipper really has like this um flare effect at the bottom of the pants like these jeans which really makes them hard as which is really the main reason why i got them it kind of reminds me a lot of people have actually asked me are these rick owens where you get your pants from like where you get your jeans from bro i said minimal la they think is rick its not this minimal you say oh this rick n this minimal straight up imma keep a real with yall these are not pants you can wear on a regular day you got to wear this on the day you putting on cuz if you wear this outside like you like a regular regular day you tripping like what you rocking out you can like no t you dont rock this on a regular day t you rock this when i like when you really putting that on you going somewhere im only putting these on when im like doing something special for the day i a i aint wearing these around the house hell no these aint no house jeans these is not no house jeans hell no but these jeans is hard as hell a few people may say oh uh the z makes that like like it kind of makes it like you feel me kind of like weird i dont want to say the word on youtube because i might get demonetized and stuff like that one i feel like its the way that you wear it and two its the person thats wearing it and i feel like i put this on with these pants like i feel like when i wore these at atlanta st market i put that on and a lot of people actually came up to me and said they f with the pants so like hey you know what im saying it is what it is basically what im trying to say is where what you want to wear dont give a about what anybody else got to say its just cloes so enough about that we going to head into the next few pickups so these next pair of camel pants we got for minimal la as well these are like some desert cargo pants that also have buttons going down the size like the last pair of pants i showed yall from on your style denim i like the overall look of these pants the type of camo that they did with these pants really go crazy like i with how they did the camo on these pants cuz i feel like it just makes them go hard really enough said about these so we head to the next pickup all right so we have these jeans from the super made we have these camo green army type of pants yeah they remind me of like you know military army type of pants they actually came with this rope yeah they came with a rope for the waistband and these are actually double waisted and you can wrap around like you can wrap the rope around like both of the waist which just how i wear these kind of like often and uh they actually fit they kind of fit weird i would let yall know if youre looking to get a pair of pants like these from the superma their sizing is weird on their um on their website so you actually got to like look and see how like their sizing chart is made because its from china make sure you look at their size and chart and stuff like that but besides that i fu with these pants though i may start wearing these more within the um springtime cuz i feel like that would be the best time to actually wear these yeah thats these pants from the superma and yeah we going hop on to the next few pickups so for these next pair of pants in todays pickup video we have these pants from black taylor and these pants bro are some crazy camo wide leg baggy type of pants these are hard twin like imma keep yall real bro when i first tried them and put them on i fell in love instantly i like the camo look just to keep it simple bro these pants go super tough man fu with these a lot love the baggy feels soon the baggy look they go tough man f these a lot and we have another pair of camo yeah camo pants from black taylor these are actually the yk i dont well yeah i dont know the exact name of these pants but im going to show the name on the screen theyre the simar version of those same pants so theyre kind of more fitted to the body if that makes sense but as you can see camo green cargo pockets on the side of the pants theyre real fire like these are hard these are hard as pants its crazy these pants are like very good quality both of the pants from black taylor are very good quality bro if you look on black taylors website they are on the precious side but i will say its is definitely worth the money because these are like the the quality is amazing the fit is amazing on these pants bro shout out to the black taylor i fold these pants a lot man besides that we going to head to the next pickup now we do have another pair of pants from black taylor once again but these are actually some khaki pants theyre the same wideleg baggy type of feel but i feel like these are more of like a casual calm type of look like i feel like i can wear these more with like casual like sneakers these are hard as hell i like the fit of these a lot i like the khaki color too i wanted to step outside my comfort zone start getting into like different type of pants if that makes sense these definitely cau my ey because the fit is good and they just look good on body when i saw them on the website i just said yeah i got to get these tn like simply said i got to have them and last but not least we actually have a pair of jorts that i want to show yall from the super made and these are some cool jorts with some distressing all over the entire pair of jords like as you can see the front has distressing everywhere the back has a little bit of distress dressing and the overall was of these js is really cool definitely gives it like a ventage type of look to them for sure and i feel like these are hard i didnt really get a chance to wear them because its been getting cold outside when spring starts up and summer starts back up you going to see me pop out in these twin like for show so we going to head into the tshirts of todays video and for the first graphic te we have this tshirt from my boy josh at gateway clothing man and when i

like this tshirt is hard i definitely follow with the front design i just feel like i got to crop it and really just make it better because i feel like its too big i dont like overly oversized shirts so im going crop this but im going leave that for another video and we going to hop into the next pickup so for the next pickup we have this long sleeve from the superma once again and this one is hard as i f with this front design like this design on the front goes crazy twin that is hard bro i got to crop it just like the last one because its too long on the bottom its too long on the bottom

9DsGALr_jfM,come thrift with me for fashion trends,okay wait this is cute hello happy i am wearing my new years themed cardigan uh can you believe that we are halfway through the s like i cant even let that sink in anyway today we are going to be thrifting for the projected trends of basically i got this list from a bunch of different fashion magazine websites saying these are going to be the trends of and as i have done in previous years basically im going to try to find as many as i can at the thrift store in most cases most of the trends have already happened so they are probably at the thrift store and my whole point with these videos is for anyone that likes any of these trends to show that maybe check out the thrift store first before buying new its basically like a trend scavenger hunt at the thrift store now these trends arent necessarily the things that im personally looking for and whats kind of trending in my world which i am going to do a separate video on that but this is what other people in the fashion industry are saying are going to be trends so i have about and im just going to go through them real quick and then well head into the thrift store the first one being polka dots which i feel stripes and well actually another one is stripes a lot of stripes so polka dots and a lot of stripes which a lot of the example photos of the stripe trend was a lot of like different shapes of stripes and probably just more stripes than a normal stripe shirt but its still stripes and also polka dots theyre just polka dots which i i think both of those would be pretty easy to find secondhand then skinny pants yes it didnt say skinny jeans but it said skinny pants so more of a tighter fit leg pant i am wearing a unitard so i can properly take off my clothes and put stuff on on top of the unitard so im not naked im not going to be naked in the thrift store but you know what i mean studs and grommets i had been seeing this kind of or at least saying that its trendy this winter and so it makes sense its going to kind of go into i am curious like how widespread it is going to be suede was one that i saw a bunch on different fashion magazine websites and it was specifically talking about in a boho contact so one of the titles was literally the boho bounceback means a surge and suede and it also talked about boho style in general i just am going to look for suede just because a lot of the other stuff was too general butter yellow is supposed to be a trend im so curious to see if burg and red kind of like goes out as a tr again people are going to still wear it obviously but i feel like everything in anything is being made in like bright red and im curious if that will then turn into butter yellow i think its a beautiful color its not really a color that i were often but i am just curious to see what i can find cwh hiide its so fascinating because in the ultra fast fashion cow print was so trendy i even participated in it and i still like it like i dont actually okay this is this is pretty funny i have i have my second hand lisa says god cow print dress here that i got at crossroads but the cow high trend is different its more of like a vintage its less fast fashion but i feel like this could still make a resurgence im making that argument that this is this is going to come back but i understand a lot of people got over it very very fast mocha moose is pan tones color of the year ive heard a lot of arguments against it of like not liking it i dont like i think the color mocha mo i dont know im kind of down with different brown tones right now im really experimenting mocha moous is a very muted brown more cool toned at at least from how i see it and yeah i just want to see if i could find it next is s mod silhouette dresses we saw drop waist dresses become a trend in the past past two years and i feel its a very similar silhouette but definitely obviously not exactly the same especially for the ones that were trending they had pleat on them but i feel the silhouette is very in lined with that and i actually wouldnt mind finding this for myself okay everything i said about potentially red going out of style or like just not being as trendy in the new year i dont think thats going to be a thing because i completely forgot one of the trends was burgundy sl cherry coated i actually saw this as a trend on pinterest like projected trends one of them was called cherry coated and i i can to i can totally see that so i also will be looking for different shades of red shaggy knits specifically d fringe brown leather skirts which in all the years ive done these videos i dont think ive ever had brown leather skirts as a trend ive had leather skirts or fashion magazines saying that its a trend but never brown leather skirts so i thought that was very interesting plaid trousers which that has my heart in the past year ive thrifted so many amazing trousers and it seems like they are also going to be a trend and lastly we have bright colored coats and it specifically said candy colored so okay those are all the trends that were going to be looking for lets head into the thrift store i want to start out going through the jackets and trying to find bright colored coats just cuz i think thats such a fun one i dont think its something thats very me but i just want to see what they possibly have also oh my goodness they have these beautiful twin gold mirrors that are absolutely gorgeous theyre super similar to my gold mirror that i actually thrifted back in that i love so much its like the oversized version and i really really want them but im not going to because i dont need them and i dont have any space i already have two thrifted mirrors in my office and so i have to i have to let them go whoever ends up thrifting them awesome for you most of the jackets just looking at them are definitely neutral you have a lot of tans grays i just saw this jacket that is kind of this corduroy its inc and i just love these buttons im actually probably going to try it on i am so surprised i think my favorite thing about these types of videos is even if i dont find the exact trend i possibly may find something else thats not even related but i wouldnt have gone into that section if it wasnt for looking at that trend you know um and this may be one of them its definitely not candy colored but its colorful ooh we have some purple this is actually pretty cool i definitely saw more wool colored not necessarily like this something more like this oh my goodness unrelated but this long suede jacket i will be i will be trying this on i am not going to get sidetracked im not going to get sidetracked im probably going to get sidetracked okay this is an orange kind of yeah kind of nice im really looking for a proper pastel one this is its yellow but not the jacket that i think is the proper trend this is more leather jackets oh my gosh this is so adorable its in an extra small definitely quite teeny tiny this leather little coat oh my goodness yeah in the leather jackets oh this is fantastic this deep brown bomber not related i know i know but i just i have i have to show you the amazing leather jackets that they have theyre just so good okay maybe still not the bright bright pastel but this red leather jacket this one is in a x so beautiful i guess this would be more what was talked about so like maybe a leather jacket in this color which i find so interesting because in pastel coats were everywhere and i feel like a lot of people then started hating them and theyre now possibly kind of coming back oh this is another fantastic jacket its in a x wilsons leather oh this one just look looks so comfy also this one beautiful brown this is like a dark brown very cute i mean maybe something like this oh its bedazzled that is so fun look at that but yeah these type of pastels which i do feel the thrift store does have but especially right now a lot of people end up doing their decluttering in january and im filming at the end of december so i feel theyll probably be a lot more jackets cuz it doesnt stay super cold in southern california so i feel people end up th or not thrifting but maybe thrifting maybe thrifting a jacket or buying a new jacket and then theyre like oh my gosh i never wear this im doing my declutter i need to say goodbye to it thats usually when they donate to the thrift store in january but i mean still theres some good stuff this just looks so comfy its almost like a crew neck but buttonup a crew neck cardigan but not knit i just really like this color not my size so im going to leave it okay this actually i think i found it candy colored coat yeah this is like a pastel pink yeah i think this is actually perfect not that im im kind of doing a scavenger hunt like i said of trends but like also not really but this one i can check off and be like okay i did find this also this is kind of of like a reminds me of like a ski jacket but it is butter yellow i think i can probably find something else in butter yellow but technically i found that as well so a check i dont know how i would style this but its just such a gem that i have to show its from rampage with a paper tag so i think its like proper vintage its this velvet almost i dont even know big shoulder pad jacket i think i do have to try it on but that in my cart we got a levis faux sherling jacket really nice to me denim is always trending okay this could be another one this is from anna klein this is almost neon not really pastel i really like the silhouette of this jacket i just dont know how fully i would style it so i am going to leave it but wanted to show that ooh we have this black suede jacket from outfit jpr i may try that on h its a little thin and i feel like id rather just wear my black leather jacket so yeah im going to leave that the dresses are right in front of me so im just going to go over here hm i dont theres so many dresses here that its like i dont even know where to start this is pretty definitely not s but mara kim just like the little sleeves trying to envision the silhouette that i want to find i dont know if this one actually would be that easy to find secondhand at the thrift store you could definitely find it on depop or something ooh i actually found two polka dot items i dont think necessarily the silhouettes that im looking for but this polka dot i mean yeah obviously im going to find polka dot at the thrift store like a du okay wait this is cute seems really really short so i i dont know but actually i think im going to try this on its from anthony richards cotton it could be like a pajama shirt honestly but i just want to try it on my mind is definitely more on like s dresses that ive been talking about so i mean part of me is like hey if i came across an amazing s dress like im not going to say no to it okay wait this is not this this is very interesting honestly this kind of reminds me of like the s oh my gosh whats so interesting is i what i dont remember when it was it may have been my thrifting trends for the new year i cant remember but i found a dress so similar to this here but it was floral i have to try this on i did not think i was going to end up potentially thrifting something polka dot not because i dont like polka dot i just want to say its the pattern im personally looking for but thats just too good even this dress is really music fun not really me but i just love actually the silhouette of it i think the issue with the mod dress is i get in my head of like oh its just up and down but it isnt fully up and down its slight slightly goes out but not in a flare type of way so this is way too up and down wait another fantastic and interesting polka dot dress this one oh it has a tie in the back too im going to try this on as well one of the buttons is broken but i feel like thats an easy fix this velvet dress kind of again it has more of an up and down almost body con style but oh this is so cute not really my color but for a holiday party i really dont usually go through every single dress when i go to the thrift store just because it can seem really overwhelming and i dont know in most cases im like oh yeah dresses are nice but i its not my most worn clothing item in my closet so i dont usually just spend a lot of time in trying to find any new ones to take in but its actually been a surprise i dont think though i am going to find the mod dress this is fun this is where is this originally from oh paper tag vintage hip chic it was originally yeah hello i just met the kindest viewer karina hi if you are watching it just like really boosts my confidence when im filming a thrift with me when i meet a viewer because sometimes im like uh im so weird im talking to myself in a thrift store so yeah thank you so much um but yeah i feel like this could give a little bit of the mod style so i may give myself a check on that it is also a pale kind of but yellow this is really cute i just dont think i would personally wear it so im going to leave it but i do feel like we found the mod silhouette im just im going to give it to myself oh this pale green twopiece set like a little blazer within the dress very adorable okay im think im done in the dresses im going to go over to skirts we have already found some polka dot so i was mainly going to go into skirts for polka dot skirts but i just kind of want to skirts in general maybe ill find a stripe skirt there actually let me just quickly go through these are like their fancy its pants and dresses and suits and just want to see if maybe they would have something oh my gosh this silhouette of dress ive seen so many places im pretty sure its like a fast fashion knockoff of i dont know what the original one is but it is is a beautiful beautiful silhouette if it was a little bit better quality if i were to ever go to the snow again cuz ive only been once when i was like i would wear this like i would really lean into to this like funky s ski vibe did you see the new skims and northface collaboration where its like just beige i mean if thats your vibe thats your vibe thats totally okay but this if this was an adult size also this like i would lean in but also i dont think i could handle actual cold the one time i was in snow technically it did snow in southern california i think in for like hours and so it it was not it was not full on snow but proper like consecutive days of really cold weather i truly could not i could not handle it i dont think i could survive i would have no reason to own this but want to own it has a paper tag i love this honestly i wouldnt want this to be like a wedding dress i know its black but why not i am already married so i dont know renewal of vows wearing all black possibility i mean i could also even just wear this it does have some like stains on the collar but it does have a paper tag def definitely vintage this is like something that my mom would have dressed me in as a kid its basically like an adult version and thats what im always wanting is an adult version of kids clothes this is i think suede this pastel purple could be candy colored jacket its just maybe a little bit thinner than a proper coat okay now im going to go into the sorry getting distracted getting distracted this is just fun it said polka dots it didnt say black and white polka dots it could be any color polka dots fantastic technically a polka dot skirt not my size but i think if i were to partake in oh this is so cute a man i wish i would have been able to give this to carrie i dont think she would like this actually but we did our like thrift swap thing a week ago when this is going live i dont think she would have liked this but maybe she would have i dont know anyway um um i dont remember what i was saying yeah oh okay polka dots i feel like in a skirt definitely is a really nice way to include polka dots if its not necessarily like your pattern i do have a polka dot dress thats originally from rampage and i love that and thats the only yeah polka dot thing i own oh im also looking for brown leather skirts i completely forgot i dont think i had seen any over here dont think id seen any leather skirts over here yeah dont see any but i just found a leather skirt but its not brown where did it go i just found it oh this it talked about maxi skirts as well though so not what we are looking for i feel like thats definitely a little more specific and niche that i think would take a little it to actually find oops i recently heard someone say that denim maxi skirts are out and that like they actually were never really in just everyone bought into it and now nobodys wearing it cuz its so ugly i am team denim skirt if i didnt already own three i would buy this one i just feel its such a nice alternative to wearing jeans obviously its an alternative wearing jeans but like its still a denim but its in a skirt so you can take an outfit that you would normally put with jeans and you put it with a denim skirt i but i get it i get that a lot of people hate it i just i love it i love it so much oh my gosh like even this one its from bdg so not from like a vintage brand or anything but im also like we this color i could create a really fun outfit with it oh this skirt okay i used to own something really similar but it was in green and i really really wanted it in red huh ill try this on its kind of a midi length this is like the color ive been looking for it is slightly itchy kind of like my green one and i did mainly wear my green one with tights so its probably how i would sell this ill put it in the cart oh sparkly sparkly sparkly oh this is completely seethrough oh you know what this reminds me of on the pinterest predicted trends i think it said like castle core which when i was talking i what video i think it was my ins and outs for i think i mentioned the whole pinterest trend thing and i wasnt trying to hate on like castle core or anything cuz there were some legitimate i guess cores and aesthetics but also i feel like aesthetics are kind of dead like nobody because brands were just using it to sell the stuff um but chain mail has definitely i mean chapel roome and this is like the sparkly version of to me chain mail so was i looking for this no but im going to give it to me that i possibly found a trend but not really oh another polka dot but this ones a big polka dot i really dont know if i like a small polka dot or a big polka dot the big polka dot is definitely in your face these are polka dots the small ones sometimes kind of messes with my eyes and the camera as well which can be kind of annoying more leather skirts but all in black oh another polka dot but in a different color thats fun i thought i saw a velvet skirt but now i cant find it i swear i had seen it was this it that i thought it was oh its over here i do want to find a another black velvet skirt cuz the one i have i love so much but the bottom is slightly damaged and i it does have like this floral detail on the bottom which i love but i would like just plain one this one alas is not in my size its in a x but so beautiful whoever ends up picking this up i am very jealous of you oh my gosh is this a velvet skirt oh i dont think this is going to be my size its by cold water creek its everything i want i do have my measuring tape so im just going to whip that out alas is a in waist whoever ends up thrifting this again im so jealous of you this skirt is so cool its not in my size but i love the brown and i also love the buttons im really feeling the big buttons do i have anything that has big buttons i dont think so i dont think i would like even if this was my size would i thrift it the buttons are so cool its just so interesting in something that is still quite simple like its not too loud its just a button thats a little bit bigger and it just feels fun this isnt part of any of the trends i am walking my way to the sweaters but i saw this and it has just like such fun fringe is this this off the shoulder oh my god its a cold shoulder b oh oh cute look at that with the fringe feel like that kind of goes with the fringe i was talking about but its not knit so not really i technically did find a lot of suede so giving a little check mark to that no brown leather skirts but okay trying to now figure out where i was going to go to the cardigans but im like do i go through the tops first oh my gosh theres just actually so much i know that these tops arent even myself i dont really wear them as often but this color is really adorable its in a medium i feel like with my shoulders not being super broad i usually need it in a small but i like that oh this is very fun too not really my style but i love the collar the little buttons on there this is a nice little top i dont know where its originally from but i really love the tone of it actually h i may put this in my cart it does you know technically go with the cherry cod coated yeah cherry cola cherry coated red slightly im just going to put in my cart i know that this isnt it and definitely not the style top but this kind of looks like the mocha moose color i think i may give that to me i feel like mocha moose i dont see that tone actually very often and this is at least from what ive seen right now the closest to mocha moose oh this is so sweet its from jones new york and i think it was made with the bow so christmas its a chenille but its more of like a vintage chenille music this is such an interesting cardigan oh its originally from shen makes a little more sense its not really like the best feeling but its like it has the buttons on the side and then theres no holes and then the buttons are on this side then this side has holes its actually quite interesting not really the best feeling but i do wish it was like a better quality because cuz i have been wanting a cardigan like this oh my gosh its kind of like a shaw almost like a poncho music h i really wished i loved these types of knits theyre like these fuzzy um ill put the name of them like the actual name of them on the screen because this is so cute and they give just such a soft look but i just absolutely hate them even just having this in my hand makes me upset because it sheds but this one even the ones that are good quality they still shed and theyre just so annoying to me but i i love them i love them on like someone else and for me to appreciate it from far away technically i found this cardigan that isnt necessarily the fringe knit trend but honestly i would say slight this would be a really perfect example of taking a trend and doing it in your own way that isnt like necessarily like a copycat of like the fringe d cardigans or sweaters that were projected as a trend this one also feels i mean its a little damaged i dont know where its originally from but something like it vintage would be really fantastic o another poncho i mean i would almost say the poncho is the perfect d fringe vibe this could kind of be butter yellow yeah i think so it does have like a warm hue to it but i think i think we found better yellow the nice part with trends and colors is its pretty broad so you can find that color in whatever style of something that you love i went through the full store and i didnt really find anything else that was super noteworthy to talk about i went to the pants to try to fine like skinny pants but i mean like they were all skinny but they also were kind of ugly and so like yeah theres going to be skinny pants at the thrift store but yeah there just nothing that was that interesting i did find these jeans though that they are a smaller leg but they kind of remind me of my boot cut midrise jeans that i recently thrifted but these ones seem slightly longer cuz the ones i have theyre just a little cropped they totally work but would like to find a longer version like a plain jean longer version of it and i figured i will try this on and technically this is a skinnier pant than what i have worn so im going to say its part of the trend its still not that busy right now in this thrift store so i am able to try on the stuff in front of a mirror so i can actually be able to see it and give my thoughts well see if it ends up getting too busy and i need to move but for right now were good this coat is so interesting so different than anything i would have ever put on my body it is missing a button right there and also right over here i dont think its necessarily super me like i cant really think of a reason of me wearing it i mean other than it being obviously very cute it definitely does not go with my outfit right now so thats not helping but i just i see the vision i do really like it and i think it kind of goes with you know a colorful coat i mean it would be really cute i just really love the buttons too im tempted but i feel this may be a little too outside of my comfort zone and i dont know if its worth the risk of me thrifting it and then like never wearing it that coat i just tried on versus this this is more me im like yeah i have so many outfits i can wear with it but i already own something quite similar a different fit but similar tone and i feel like i would just wear that one its a little more fitted as well so i probably could only wear a long sleeve whereas the other one is just a little looser easier for layering but i like this one better so i feel like between both of them i shouldnt thrift either of them but very very cute when they said lets add shoulder pads to this jacket they meant like oh my goodness i am a football player i could ram into somebody with my shoulder pads right now and i would feel absolutely nothing oh my goodness it is such a fascinating like silhouette i have gone in and out of favor of shoulder pads throughout the year sometimes i love them sometimes i hate them these are so intense that it feels like i would hate them but actually theyre so outrageous that i love them like its interesting its like okay give me shoulder and like the silhouette but then getting like put in in the waist the zipper on the side is broken like its supposed to go like fold over but its broken on the side i dont know when i would wear this so i am g to leave it for somebody else who will absolutely rock this beautiful vintage rampage velvet shoulder pad jacket please rock it for me cuz this is beautiful i just dont think im in my shoulder pad journey where i would be able to give it the wear that it deserves im wearing the absolute best thing i could be wearing to try on this dress i see the vision it is missing a button so that would just need to be fixed right here im just a little unsure like its cute but it may be a little too kind of modest vi i dont know i totally see it cuz i have a dress almost exactly the same its just floral so like how can i love that dress but not this one i dont know i it is really cute but im just trying to think would i wear it with some brown boots yes i dont know let me try on the other well i have two more polka dot things to try on i do prefer the other polka dot dress over this this one this one just its kind of fine i dont know i really i wish it was more of a scoop neck than a vneck but yeah this ones just this is so many like my butt my little shorts are like right there its basically a top but i kind of actually really like it but it looks like im not wearing any pants i mean maybe if i had some like bloomers but i i had had i have had blo and i never wore them but this would be a piece i would wear it with i actually do really like it but it also gives pajamas so this ones a i dont know im quite unsure about this skirt i think it does need a new elastic in it its almost like the elastic its like too loose but then putting it on and on was such a hassle i think with just a new elastic it would be fine i do really like it its literally almost exactly the same as my green one but i just feel like i would wear this one more these jeans are a lot more skinny than i thought i thought they were going to be more of a boot cut and yeah not really what im looking for so i am going to leave them im very unsure on what i am actually going to get i think definitely the plaid skirt that is worth it to get a new elastic in and then maybe the polka dot dress i dont know i am just going to put everything back where i originally got them go into maybe the purses and the home decor core which ill add any clips if i see anything cute i will see you after i check out with whatever i do end up checking out music with all righty we are back home it has actually been a couple of weeks since i filmed that thrift with me and when i was looking back over the footage i do feel like i found most of the projected trends at the thrift store so im going to give myself some claps i actually even did thrift one of the trends and i dont think i would have had my eye out for it if it wasnt for specifically searching for the trends which i do need to give some context for this first item because im going to be honest i wasnt initially going to buy it basically it is this polka dot dress that i was feeling super indecisive about getting when i initially tried it on and even after putting away all of my nose i tried it on again and was walking through the thrift store really trying to figure out if the fit was how i wanted it to fit and i even was filming myself doing different movements and maneuvers in the dress to basically share like oh i tried it on again and i was still feeling indecisive about about it so im going to leave it and if you follow me on instagram then you already know what happened i lifted my leg and ended up launching the bottom button into the air luckily it did not hit anyone but definitely one of the most embarrassing things that has ever happened to me at the thrift store and i just took that as a sign to get it because i would not be able to sleep ever again because of the guilt if i had put the dress back after i had damaged it so i will be fixing the bottom button as well as the middle button i think i mentioned it in the initial tryon that it was broken other than that though it is in great condition and it was but i had a off coupon so i got off so im taking it as a win the next thing i got was the plaid skirt but i realized the next day that it was a regretful purchase because i already own a plaid red skirt so i ended up going to a different thrift store and exchanging it for this cardigan the plaid skirt was so that went towards this making it and i ended up filming a little bit of that thrift trip because there were so many amazing pieces but i did only end up getting this which was originally from quint its organic cotton this cardigan is originally and it is probably one of the best quality cardigans i have ever felt belt so im going to consider this one also a win the last thing i picked up during the actual thrift with me thrift store was this gold mirror it was but i got off and i felt it was a good compromise from those big massive gold mirrors this ones more realistic its quite light and i think for the gallery wall im planning its going to be perfect this thrift trip was the perfect way to start out and itll be cool to see what trends from the list do actually end up trending which thank you all so much for watching my very first video

AaCoEy_3Vt0,fashion trend predictions,has been a great year for fashion with the rise of workware being an official aesthetic now even adidas making a comeback with sambas taking over the shoe game this year has definitely been one of the best years in fashion trust me you do not want to go back to however theres only one week left of and will be officially into do your math boy so without further ado here are the trends that will take over fashion in and at the end of this video ill be breaking down the sneaker game a bit more into detail so you dont want to miss out about that first thing is george going to die yes jorts i know they came back in yeah them john cena pants yeah trust me theyre going to be dead this year especially with the rise of the pants theyre definitely going to be taking over and replacing the spots george had this past summer now look i know this past summer you had everybody wearing jords i dont know how these came back i was never a fan of them i think theyre all right theyre cool but um i dont know every time i see somebody wear them i think theyre trying to replicate john cenas order i just dont get it and nobody could have predicted that fashion prediction of george coming back who who could have ever predicted that but i realized as people get bored people are willing to try new things whether theyre ugly or not but just like most pant trends this ones going to die pretty quick well only a year reign of and and this is honestly due to the fact that not everybody can rock jorts if theyre too short theyre going to look sassy and if your legs are too skinny youre going to look like a minecraft skeleton however i believe these will be replaced with the pain aka the high waters which are going to continue to grow in due to them being a better and longer version of jords also expect the yk suit and thai aesthetic to continue to grow in as well as these were probably the biggest aesthetic to blow up in honestly ive seen so many people on pinterest and instagram rock this aesthetic right here and honestly its a out of aesthetic i love it soon tai is coming back a little bit of vintage throwing in there uh thats kind of hard im not going to lie that was definitely probably the most popular hottest aesthetic to come out of lets be real and theyre just getting more popular as each day goes on but ezra what about vintage is vintage going to be around let me tell you this vintage is in its peak right now i dont think itll continue to grow any more than what it already has because you see everybody rock vintage you got the urban kids middle class kids to the suburban to the old money wearing mother they all they all wearing that they all wearing vintage everybodys wearing vintage now look i think there will come a time probably this summer where tik tok npc start to say oh vintage is boring now its annoying everybodys wearing it but heres the thing though its not going to fall into that fall off trend i think its going to surpass that little trend that its eventually going to hit people are going to continue to wear it even past i think itll last probably maybe till like i see it having a pretty long run just because the fact that theyre essentials and they are they are also cheap to buy and as well as also seeing designer putting in their effort into making more vintage like items with their you know with their clothing brand you see balenciaga taking a step in this direction and a lot of other designer brands trying to take that step into making vintage life pieces that will work with your vintage outfits so because of that i think theyre going to have a pretty long run i dont see them dying anytime soon but i dont see them growing as much either i think theyre just going to continue to you know stay at their level therell be a time where people try to start hating on it but i think itll surpass this fallof arc for sure however throw away your puffers yes puffers are in their downfall right now you know why because everybodys taking their puffers and throwing them out to replace them with bomber jackets bomber jackets are the trend right now bomber jackets quarter zipups now before i even continue that list bomber jackets are just classier they look better with your vintage outfits they look better with your old money aesthetics opium aesthetics earth tone aesthetics every aesthetic you could think of bomber jackets works completely well in and its because they give off a more classier vibe they look even better with your light blue jeans which we know we are in a light blue jean era right now the light blue jean arc is still in its prime we see every kid nowadays wear light blue jeans no other jeans but light blue jeans another thing coming back is leather jackets which i dont even know why they died in the first place because leather jackets are that fire now this is probably due to back in the s and s you know fashion was definitely divided by culture back then you wouldnt see a black guy wearing white people clothing you wouldnt see a white guy wearing black people clothing thats just how i was back in those days but nowadays boy i see asians wearing nike text we live in a new age you see how hot leather jackets are theyre tough right now definitely recommend you cop one definitely going to take your or probably plus aa points honestly im im going to be real but leather jackets look even better with buttonups underneath long sleeve buttonups flannels these have been going off in like crazy yall see it everybody is wearing these nowadays you can easily find these at thrift stores theyre going crazy right now and honestly i predicted that these will make a comeback to years ago but nobody was believing me back then and i wasnt on here making you know what im saying youtube videos i was out there just talking to my home you feel me but yes long sleeve buttonups and flannels are going to continue to strive in before what flannels were just like a mul brand thing it was just like what your your frat boys would wear back in but yeah its its completely moved past that to becoming its own wear nowadays which you see a lot of people hopping on to and you see it a lot in the y k study however what do these look great with slim pants yes slim pants not skinny jeans not skinny leather pants which i know a lot of opium wear is wearing nowadays but honestly those are starting to die out and a lot of people are moving towards baggy pants baggy pants and slim pants and when i mean slim i mean fitted not too skinny not too two baggy just that perfect fitting styled pants which you see a lot of people wearing nowadays and this is going to continue to grow even more into because a lot of people are going to realize you cant wear baggy jeans and baggy sweatpants until you get tired of tripping over your leg sleeves over and over and over again and you can also expect your yk parachute pants to continue to be a train this year as well this is something i ced and got into earlier this year and honestly i ive cau like three or four of these pants theyre being bought everywhere and i highly recommend you get them but for other pants like double knee pants going crazy right now especially in the work whereare seen i definitely recommend you continue to cop your your double knee pants whenever you can get those on sale cuz theyd be expensive sometimes and also your car heart jackets dont forget about your car hard jacket we love car hard but lets get back to them quarter zipups i mentioned earlier quarter zipups are definitely the hottest sweaters right now in the game you got to cop these in theyre going to continue to be even bigger and better than what they were in im going to be real i done seen four other dudes the other day back to back to back in my grocery store all have quarter zipper theyre trendy and theyre going to continue to skyrocket in for sure so stick to your work wear work wear is perfect you can wear it at work school church anything but the gym now we also seen the rise of camouflage pants this year which will also continue to be a bigger trend in as well i dont think theyre going to be a huge trend but i think theyre going to continue where they are now and kind of i dont know maybe plateau in a way but these have come up a long way from being to where well i seen a black dude wear it two weeks ago i never thought id see the day a black man would wear a camouflage hoodie or camouflage pants and hes not in the marines boy your culture this is definitely the best era of fashion and you got the mix of different cultures going all types of way you got urban kids wearing classier fits and you got classy kids wearing urban fits its crazy bro i love i love fashion nowadays it has definitely changed a lot more than what it was even years ago and camouflage pants are also becoming popular as well because they come in an earth tone colorway yes green its an earth tone its going to look great with a lot of your other earth tone outfits and its also going to look great in nature and in you you feel me youre youre going to blend into nature perfectly fine but most importantly shoes the meteor fits paul this is instantly the most important trend that you have to stay on top of because if youre still wearing panda dunks in im sorry to tell you you will get roasted and you will get clowned on every time you go to school because panda dunks are irrelevant were in the days of age of sas and small shoes thicker shoes not basic jordans and nikes come on my guy you can step up come on buy some new balances please however sneakers arent the only things you should be keeping your eyes on you should also be keeping your eyes on boots outdoor hiking shoes expect these to blow up in and become even bigger than what they are now boots like tims or even outdoor hiking sho shoes like merils ke these are going to take over watch theyre just going to take over the shoe game next year i promise you just like how new balances and a has been taking over the past couple years oh watch im telling you my boy im telling you hiking shoes are up next this is due to their chunky but still natural essential look that looks great in work wear outfits now a and new balances will still be hot yes your dad shoes who we never thought were going to become you know a trend ever before are finally a trend now weve seen them rise from what they were in to to and theyre going to continue to i think right now theyve hit their peak and i think theyre going to continue to stay at the same level unless new balance or as come up with some new better designs which i think will eventually come along the way as they see their stocks and their money go through the roof because everybodys buying their sneakers right now however i predict sketchers might be up next now a lot of people have been predicting sketchers for years now only because they know theyre also dashes however sketchers has some weak designs not all of their designs look great however there is a small tik tok community im not going to lie people still messing with sketcher still giving it that boost still buying their still buying their sneakers giving them reviews and all that i if they improve their designs in and come up with something that can compete against as or new balances they might be up next and i think people are going to hop on the sketcher waves and its going to is going to be up here with as and new balances probably within the next year but there is one secret shoe which is loki has a underground i wouldnt even say secret its a loki has that underground fashion wave going on right now that you see all over tik tok as well yes unfortunately tik tok leads fashion nowadays and that shoe is the puma speed cat ive seen this on tik tok and a lot of people have been predicting that these are are going to you know skyrocket in so i definitely recommend you cop them now and one thing is is because they have a slimmer small aesthetic of a shoe as well as not only that but theyre also hidden you havent really heard of puma really popping off the past couple years puma hasnt popped off in what years these are definitely up next and also because the fact that they have a slim sneaker look which is going to look great because theyre getting swallowed by your jeans and you know how popular that look is now and because theyre underrated and not talked about just watch how everybody starts glazing them and it becomes a trend later in however if you

_BoWpnXllvI,shes and dresses like a fashion icon fashion trends,ive always truly believed that theres no age limit when it comes to style and nobody embodies this statement better than yearold style icon linda v right i first discovered linda on instagram and have been so inspired by her style i wanted to take a deep dive into her looks and unlock her best kept fashion secrets so this is the first episode in a brand new series where i take a deep dive to break down the fashion secrets of some of the most stylish and related women on the planet i often talk about the importance of finding your own fashion muses to help inspire some of your own style choices and this is exactly what this series is about now today is all about linda and im breaking down her outfits to unlock some of her best kept style secrets im also taking a look at some of her fashion musthaves now these are the pieces that she uses as a foundation to most of her outfits and no what these are will help you also unlock your very own idea of aged defying style so lets kick things off with finding out a little bit more about who linda is so linda is an americanborn former model she moved to paris in the s and totally embraced that chic perisian way of life including the fashion she even spent a number of years as an apprentice at ralph luren so shes lived and breathed fashion and fashion trends her whole life shes also a mother of two and she owns a quaint fashion boutique in the heart of paris called crimson cashmere where she sells beautiful cashmere knits and accessories and ill leave a link to crimson cashmere in the description box below so you can go and check it out after this video now if i had to describe her signature style i would call it modern classic it has a french flare with a bit of a tomboyish edge her style shouts parisian and you can definitely see that ralph luren influence coming through too and after taking a closer look at lindas instagram page ive realized that its simpler than you may expect to unlock some of her best outfit combinations looking at lindas feed her new favorite color is orange and she uses this beautiful bold shade to add a real zing to some of her more classic pieces like camel pants and denim jeans which also happen to be two of her faves in fact she uses a lot of bright pops of color to give her outfits a bit of a dopamine hit mostly she pairs them back with neutrals and earthy tones or denim but she also pairs them back with black shes not afraid to wear color and teaming unexpected colors together to create showstopping outfits and recently she seems to be a real fan of pant sets now i am a huge fan of sets i love the fact that you get that versatility with them you get that that one anddone piece of wearing them together and you also get the option of wearing them as separates too let me know in the comments below do you guys like sets coords whatever you like to call them ive kind of really leaned into them over the last couple of seasons and find them super versatile but id love to know what you think so let me know in the comments below recently been pictured on instagram sporting a couple of different printed pants sets too which are gorgeous and both really colorful wears them together as an outfit and she breaks them up and teams them with a solid color that appears in the print and if you ask me this is a really savvy way of creating a cohesive outfit often she wears one of her signature pieces which is a cashmere sweater now thats not surprising given that she owns crimson cashmere and has some of the most luxurious cashmere sweaters on offer linda has talked in interviews about loving a great cashmere sweater and it seems that these are really key pieces in her wardrobe ive also noticed that she seems to layer the same colors too so shell wear two or three pieces in the same color to sort of add dimension and texture to an outfit this styling trick is something she does all the time shes a master of tonal dressing too but her wardrobe is anything but bland i love how she often adds a bright pair of socks or a colorful beanie just to add that little bit of interest to her looks these details also really help to define her style and give it some added fun when shes not wearing bright pops of color linda wears muted monochrome outfits and uses textured pieces in similar tones to add interest and when i first started studying lindas outfits one of the things that i realized is that shes a big fan of accessories and she uses accessories really wisely just to add some interest to her looks shes a huge fan of scarves and seems to add one to many of her looks shes also very daring with how she wears them shes not afraid to style them as a bandan as you can see here tied in her hair or even more traditionally around her neck or shoulders she also has a fabulous collection of sunglasses to give all of her outfits a different vibe i actually think owning a few pairs of sunglasses is a great way to change up your looks shes also a huge fan of wearing pants and jeans it seems these pieces make up the bulk of her wardrobe kind of leaning into that whole tomboyish vibe those basics are modern too so she regularly wears wideleg pants and slightly cropped jeans to show off her favorite chunky boots and when it comes to footwear she tends to only wear flats in the way

klKVm1FALhs,how to make your outfits better elevate your daily style,whats good today im going to recreate some of my old outfits and make them better how am i gonna do that well im gonna walk you through the whole process and hopefully this video can help you learn how to upgrade your outfits as well fashion is in the details and there are a few small but intentional choices that you can make to elevate your daily style and make a huge impact on your overall look if this video helps you in any way be sure to give it a like and subscribe if you havent already now lets get into it if you look at all of these older outfits they all kind of have something in common what is that well one of the biggest fashion mistakes that i made in the past is not understanding fit and proportion and thats mainly because i didnt understand my body now let me walk you through what i mean by this when i used to gather outfit inspiration from pinterest i thought that i could just use any sweater or any coat as long as it was similar i also thought well this girl is skinny and im skinny too so itll look the same on me theres two gigantic mistakes that i made here the first mistake i made is not understanding fit the material stiffness and cut of a garment is what determines the overall look of a piece for example a lightweight blazer is going to have a very different look from a wool blazer because the stiffness of the wool creates a more structured look so if you see a pinterest girly wearing thick plaid pants and you try to recreate the outfit with lightweight plaid pants you might think oh well shes wearing plaid pants i have plaid pants so it should work out but youre going to get a very different outfit simply because of the weight and structure of the fabric the second mistake i made is not understanding proportion and a lot of that had to do with the fact that i didnt understand my body now i used to think that i had super broad shoulders because when you objectively look at the shape of my body my shoulders are wider than my hips so i was like yeah i have broad shoulders but then i started coming across pictures of celebrities that actually had broad shoulders and i thought to myself hmm maybe my shoulders arent as broad as i thought they were and so i pondered on this for a very long time until i had an epiphany and came to the realization that its not that my shoulders are broad its that my hips are really narrow this piece of information was invaluable to me because i was able to learn that different types of fabrics styles and cuts will fall on my body differently than someone with wider shoulders or wider hips another huge piece of information that i learned about my body is that i have really long legs in comparison to my torso now some people have long legs and a short torso some people have a long torso and short legs and some people are more balanced regardless clothing is going to look different on different proportions if youre going to recreate an outfit that you see someone else wearing you need to consider their proportions as well as your own for example someone with a longer torso and wider hips looks very different for me even if were wearing a similar outfit music now these two things are kind of why im reluctant to agree with that hole is this a good outfit or is she just skinny sort of thing because look i see skinny people with terrible outfits all the time i mean look at these foreign is that celebrities have stylists and stylists understand everything that i just talked about they understand fit and proportions and the way different fabrics drape around different body types celebrities pay good money to look good everyone has the ability to be stylish you do not need to be skinny to have good outfits you just need to understand your proportions and the fit and cut of the clothing that youre buying make your closet work for you not the other way around now that weve got all that covered lets put all that knowledge into practice and recreate some of my old outfits together thank you okay so i can immediately identify why this outfit doesnt work the biggest one is that these jeans have way too short of an inseam remember how i said i have long legs and a short torso well these jeans are too short on me another thing i can identify is that the pant legs kind of taper inwards because i have narrow hips and wider shoulders these tapered pants bring attention to the fact that i have very narrow hips and this makes the outfit look very imbalanced lets swap out these jeans with these these jeans are longer which is much more suitable for the length of my legs and they are slightly flared which balances out my narrow hips having black on top and white on the bottom is way too much contrast for this outfit especially because my body doesnt have balance proportions so lets switch out this black shirt with this cropped white one this is much more balanced right look at how big of a difference being more intentional makes all right three key issues with this one number one these are the same jeans that i was wearing in the first outfit theyre too short number two tapered legged pants look better with a more narrow shoe these boots are too chunky for these jeans creating an imbalance number three its kind of hard to tell with this lighting but this blazer is quite fit to the body yet the shirt that im wearing underneath is pretty loose this makes the shirt look super wrinkled because theres too much fabric that isnt accommodated by the fit of the blazer and it was honestly quite uncomfortable to wear because of that so lets fix this lets switch out the jeans with the same pair from outfit one now personally when i wear pants and a shirt i like to show skin somewhere to break up that kind of solidness of an outfit and add more interest otherwise it can feel a bit overwhelming and uncomfortable like im drowning in clothing in the first outfit i achieved this with a cropped tshirt but in this outfit im going to do this with a vneck top well this is actually a bodysuit but you know the vibes boom this is already looking way more balanced im going to keep the same color scheme here so im gonna wear these black booties as you can see they are much more narrow of a silhouette than the other boots and theyre also a lot point tier which in my opinion looks more striking and adds more visual interest so im gonna put these on in the original outfit you can see that the blazer is quite snug this outfit is pretty casual and i want to feel comfortable in this outfit so im going to switch out that blazer for this one that is way looser of a fit also i found that doublebreasted blazers look kind of weird on me anyway i think its because i have a narrow body so its too much fabric for me and it makes me feel and look like im drowning with that being said if you are trying to recreate someones outfit consider the fit of the clothes that the person is wearing music okay theres a lot going on here i dont know what i was thinking when i put this outfit together like what was that about so lets fix it now i still have this shirt but heres why i dont really wear it these days this shirt is very thin and flimsy because of this it wrinkles very easily and it clings to my body in very unflattering ways i mean look at the way its clinging to my bust area its super uncomfortable when you have to constantly mess around with your clothing throughout the day personally i feel way more confident in my outfit when i know that it looks good no matter how its laying on my body with this shirt i am constantly worried about it clinging in unflattering ways and im always messing with it on the other hand lets take a look at this graphic tee the fabric is quite thicker and theres a little bit more structure in the shoulders so it doesnt cling to my body it falls on it like a hanger this is a much more comfortable and flattering type of graphic tee for me anyway now keep in mind that these are both mens shirts and theyre both the same size the key difference here is the fabric weight or density one clings and one falls lets go with the more flattering option these pants that im wearing in the older outfit were trousers like a business casual trouser and i love trousers i wear them when i want to be put together and i wear them even when im styling a streetwear outfit i just love the juxtaposition i love trousers the problem here is that these are not the trousers for me theyre too short and once again they are tapered now i dont know why i had so many short tapered pants maybe it was the trend at the time but it was not the trend for me thats why its so important to understand your body and have a personal style because if you just follow trend after trend they might not work for you they might not look good you might not be comfortable and itll be a complete waste of money but anyway back to the pants were gonna swap these out for these trousers wow what a difference theyre a much better length and again they slightly flare out to create more balance plus these are pleated and because i have narrow hips this little pleat detail adds a little more volume to my hip area making me look more balanced this color palette is all over the place im actually going to keep the red shoes for a pop of color but were gonna switch out this jacket for a black one because look that just makes more sense now i was probably wearing that jacket because it was a little cold outside so im gonna match the energy here and put on this lightweight puffer boom to accessorize im gonna wear this red bag so that your eyes go across the outfit without the bag your eyes go straight to the shoes you know what im saying so matching that bag with the shoes makes your eyes see the outfit as a whole it goes from top to middle to bottom as opposed to like just go into your shoes whiz what a terribly proportioned outfit wowzers two main issues with this one one its very top heavy im wearing this furry jacket thing which is huge compared to the bottom half of my body which is a terrible combination for someone who has no hips this outfit is bringing attention to the fact that there are no hips there the other issue is the skinny jeans now look if you want to keep wearing your skinny jeans then you should do that i personally dont think that they are the most flattering type of pant for a majority of body types again if youre comfortable in your skinny jeans and you love them then you should keep wearing them but if youre like me and you only ever wore skinny jeans because they were the trend at the time and not because they actually look good or are comfortable to wear then consider not wearing them anymore explore literally any other type of pants and yes i am talking to you fellow millennials once you release yourself from the chains of skinny jeans you will find fashion so much more exciting because there are so many different types of pants out there now for me the reason why i dont like skinny jeans especially in this picture is because i have narrow hips and these highwaisted skinny jeans are not doing anything for me i also have really skinny long legs i look like a pair of training chopsticks so lets fix this lets make this outfit monochromatic boom less contrast means that my uneven proportions are less pronounced we are also not wearing skinny jeans anymore we got flared pants on look lots of women dont have that perfect hourglass shape i would actually say that most of us dont im one of them i will never look like this but i can create an hourglass silhouette by making my pants flare out at the bottom to mirror my shoulder line this looks much more balanced doesnt it okay i dont hate this outfit i think it looks all right but there are a few tweaks that we can make to make it an outfit you know what im saying like right now this is this is just i but we want a look you feel me because right now i look like a silicon valley tech bro that just discovered what an overcoat is so lets start with the sweater lets swap this out with a crew neck sweatshirt the original sweater was a turtleneck and i felt a little claustrophobic in it especially because im wearing so much fabric in this outfit the lowered neckline of this new sweater feels a lot more comfortable for me the sweatpants in the original outfit are tapered at the bottom and because this sweatshirt is a little loose fitting i dont want to be heavy on the top and skinny on the bottom because this is going to create that same imbalance that i had in that last outfit im gonna put on a pair of looser fit sweatpants i think having an exposed ankle with sweatpants can look a little awkward so im going to swap out these low top sneakers for high tops this coat is nice i still have it but i havent been wearing it as often because i recently got another one that fits me way better this one is longer so it harmonizes really well with my elongated body the other coat that i had was shorter and i dont know how to explain it but it was a really awkward length for how long i am in contrast when my mom who is quite a bit shorter than me wears a coat with a similar length it looks more harmonious on her in my personal opinion if youre on the taller side or if youre shorter but you have really elongated limbs a longer coat looks better this is just my opinion this coat also fits looser if you look at the beige coat the shoulder lines are closer to the collarbone whereas the darker coat has a more elongated shoulder line and the armpits are positioned much lower this is great because it leaves room for any loose fitting sweater that you wear underneath so while the original outfit wasnt necessarily bad it was kind of just okay this new outfit has a lot more flavor its a little bit more stylish and those small changes that we made have a really big impact on the overall look so what do you guys do you think the new outfits are an improvement let me know which recreation was your favorite in the comments down below if you learned something new in

cosmopolitan and its all to bring you kind of a comprehensive list and amalgamation of all of those lists so that that we can stay in style but most importantly inspired for the year ahead in fashion

is absolutely the best what do you want to try what are you going to skip leave it down in the comments grab a cozy bevy get comfy and lets jump right into to the trends that are going to define lets start the fashion trends with a pattern that is making a big bold statement this year and that is stripes on stripes well stripes have always been a spring summer staple i know for me this year runways took them to a whole another level theyre mixing theyre matching theyre layering and theyre doing it all in unexpected ways stripes were a grounding force on the spring runways appearing in collections from designers like penza schooler erm tory burch and even chanel whether showcased on sharply tailored suits slinky blouses or bold statement coats stripes added a fresh refined edge to a classic motif but there is a twist for and its not not just about wearing stripes its about layering stripes on stripes think maximalism with a playful touch so how do you do this mix with different widths directions and colors and stripes for a pattern on pattern look that feels more modern and definitely more fun i love a little bit of fashion history and stripes have definitely a rich one once reserved for societal outcast in medieval europe they later became a symbol of freedom during the american revolution and today theyre embraced as versatile timeless motif for were seeing stripes reimagined to embody both preppy sophistication and bold individuality so if you already have stripes in your wardrobe you are definitely ahead of the game i know i do but this year its time to push the envelope and experiment with color combinations mix those proportions as we talked about and dont be afraid to just mix and match general striped pieces its all about making this timeless pattern your own and lets actually make that the rule for all of these trends our second trend for is the one one that is dominating every single fashion list and definitely unexpected for me its all about the legs the trend is bold its experimental and to be honest its a little bit puzzling when you see it first from asymmetrical silhouettes to the revival of hot pants designers are putting a spotlight on the legs and in ways weve never quite seen before so lets start with the runways victoria beckham bga vanetta polo ralph lauren cerne introduced us to hybrids like scants sc trousers and onelegged pants think trousers sliced to reveal satin shorts underneath or asymmetrical hemlines that spot like just one leg matteo blazy creative director of bka vanetta even took it a step further with a threeway pant short skirt hybrid its off on guard its playful and its completely unexpected but leg focus doesnt just stop there dresses over pants are also making a comeback at kate roa duran lan all giving pants kind of that starring role for spring summer wardrobes and leggings yes leggings have also been reimagined designers like penza schooler tibby sonia rael have layered under trousers bermuda shorts and tunics for a fresh modern look and if that wasnt enough leg drama we are also seeing the return of hot pants and micro minis a throwback to daring styles that i think really comes from sabrina carpenter first look revealed cosmopolitan is calling it a year of the micro which in my opinion is what we saw two years ago but sure theyre highlighting itsybitsy shorts paired with sheer tights or war bear depending on how bold you are feeling trust me when it comes to these trends i get it while this trend may not screen practicality it is undeniably fun and really creative whether its layering asymmetrical pants layering with leggings pairing with a dress or trousers it kind of just encourages you to dive into your wardrobe and have some fun person l i cant wait to see how the top fashion ees are going to bring this to life during fashion week and not just the hot pants i know weve already seen that um during some of the fashion weeks and the girlies theyve been doing it so well but ill be honest i dont see myself doing this unless im feeling really hot at night and i need to kick my leg out of the um out of the sheets in my bed but maybe thats actually where the designers came up with it a little am idea when feeling a little bit hot on one side of their body you guys know i also love to talk about the hemline of the year and this year the next trend is growing quite literally the bubble silhouette if youve been keeping an eye on fashion trends you might remember that the bubble skirt or voluminous shapes kind of began to emerge a little bit more last year but it seems that is the year that we are fully embracing this inflated sculptural style vogue describes this trend as cloud with inflated shapes and bubble hems creating powerful poof dresses that are stuffed or even inflatable and i know thats pushing the boat out a little bit for a lot of us more traditional bubble silhouettes offer wearable alternatives for those looking to test the waters and for me i think these are really really pretty harpers bazaar took a playful approach calling it cuckoo for tutu so minik skirts peplums and dresses in bubbled silks and classic tulle they dominated the runways as they saw by jw anderson simon rosa and viera think of it as tool reimagined but for the modern wardrobe refiner really liked to give us a historical perspective which i love and they were saying that the bubble skirt was an unlikely comeback from the s or the early s this season silhouette has evolved into what they describe as more of a curve obsession at stella mccartney it was toga inspired dresses featuring bubble hemmed minis while designers like nicholas skovgard l and junia wabi took the volume to new heights with hoop skirts and impossible dramatic dresses maybe not something youd wear to the grocery store but definitely art in motion so why is this gaining traction now well i feel like it just hasnt had its spotlight yet maybe we just needed time to warm up to this concept and the world to really be ready to embrace a little bit more of a playful silhouette whether you prefer a bubbled midi skirt or a dramatic mini skirt or even a pum top this trend is about having fun and with shape and movement specifically well talk more about movement in a moments time but fashion is all about experimentation so if you already have your basics maybe add a bubble silhouette just to offer that bit of fun in your spring summer wardrobe speaking to more patterns plaid is making a significant resurgence in seamlessly blending timeless appeal with contemporary fashion and designers are reimagining this classic pattern with unexpected colorways and innovative applications ensuring that its relevance across seasons kind of stays all through the year when normally i just associate it with gilmore girl season which is otherwise known as fall winter whats up my pretty pretty face on the spring summer runways plaid was predominantly featured maybe unexpectedly in jackets tunics and skirts with designers like bga vanetta sakai and balenciaga showcasing the pattern in fresh hues and in modern silhouettes this revival isnt limited to high fashion by any means its permeating street style and everyday wear and the versatility of plaid allows it to be dressed up or dressed down making it staple for various occasions whether that means embracing a countryside chic aesthetic which is definitely on the rise by the way or incorporating plaid into urban ensembles this pattern offers endless styling opportunities so now i will just turn this to you quickly the enduring nature of plaid raises the question is it a timeless pattern many fashion enthusiasts including myself definitely believe that it is its ability to to adapt and remain relevant through changing trends definitely speaks to its lasting appeal and i think its brands like ralph lauren who have really carved out this space in my brain its an aesthetic all of its own as we integrate plaid into our wardrobes throughout the entire year consider experimenting with different color schemes and garment types to really make this classic pattern uniquely your own we are already at trend number five and i feel like its straight out of a countryside fairy tale the dream and that is the case the timeless piece that is making the modern comeback blending elegance and novelty to give our spring and fall wardrobes a fresh twist whether its a standalone cape or capes built into dresses ill explain more this trend brings a refined but dramatic flare to everyday style i have a cape and i need to start wearing it capes are definitely associated with a certain theatricality but in think more of a soft approachable grounded in quiet luxury tape refin highlights how capes capelets emerged as an unexpected offshoot of the ladylike trend which well talk a little bit more again later and a lighter more wearable option that continues to dominate the runways and its definitely taking notice too totems draped goddess dress for example subtly incorporates capik layers and an ethereal effect while chanel offers a playful superhero inspired version mary cla points out that capes for spraying arent just about making a statement its really just fluidity and east designers like elia kate aem tibby theyre all crafting them from delicate fabrics like soft jerseys tafas and lace which is so pretty creating an effortless billowy drape that feels far from costume like and more like everyday elegance the beauty of this trend is its versatility capes can serve as a stylish alternative to a trench coat um they can also work beautifully as part of a dress or an unexpected detail in outerwear its a piece that adds drama and refinement while still definitely remaining practical for the transitional seasons so whether you are channeling your countryside chic or experimenting with soft fluid silhouettes the cape is here to help you make a statement and a very versatile wearable tonal cape is definitely on my wish list for spring and fall in i feel like a little bit of a broken record with trend number six but its been evolving over the past few years and that is strategic shear note strategic in the name this time strategic shear dressing shear has been a constant on the trend list but for i feel like its taking a more thoughtful and wearable approach finally this year its less about bearing it all and more about incorporating elements of shear in ways that feel intentional and elegant and so many designers are doing this in such a beautiful way designers like prada and aes are redefining the idea of shear with panels and cutouts that add kind of that sexy but yet sophisticated detail vog describes this as a soft filter where tulle just wraps and diaphanous layers create a romantic and ethereal look we saw that on pras runway last year actually refinery takes it to set further highlighting designers like siman rosa and marina mcone who are building entire collections around fluid gossamer fabrics think twists of tulle sheer overdresses and flowing pants that catch the breeze its so romantic these fabrics really let your under layer shine without being too overtly revealing mary cla emphasized that shear doesnt have to mean naked anymore this season its about reclaiming shear as wearable and refined so kind of reinforcing that message gauzy maxi dresses embroidered textures and open weave skirts that has me so excited for spring paired with minimalist separates offer a way to embrace this trend while definitely staying versatile yet comfortable finally if you were hesitant about this sheer in the past i know i was as ive mentioned in i think it is our year to give it a go this strategic approach allows you to really embrace the transparency in a way that feels polished yet modern entirely your own i think the first place that i would start would be a sheer blouse with a really beautiful chamisol underneath trend number seven is sport lux where athleisure gets a serious upgrade for again another one thats been mentioned for a few years in a row but can you believe that its been years since we were living in sweatpants on zoom calls thats where this sporty style has been trending ever since and this year we are finally stepping into a little bit more of a luxurious yet elevated realm is just about raising the bar vogue highlights how slim and sleek tank silhouettes were once reserved for the gym theyre now gracing the runways and designers like christan dior are incorporating sporty details into sophisticated looks theyre pairing windbreakers that are more in satin and nylon with sequin dresses or a billowy polo dress that sweeps the floor refinery i love this they coin this as sporty spice meets office chic think color blocked windbreakers paired with midi skirts or funnel neck anax styled with trousers and short sleeve polar dresses that feel polished enough to go to a meeting but casual enough to also go to brunch designers like lacost gany and famo are leading the way with subtle yet elevated takes on sporty staples mary cla really leaned into the playful side of this trend with bold biker shorts and color blocking paired with unexpected elements like sequin dresses and floral l fur tory birch prada mason theyre all embracing this bold mix of technical and glamorous elements creating a look that feels fresh and dynamic whether you are rocking a funnel neck windbreaker color blocked track separates or a satin windbreaker paired with sequin dresses sport lux is here to refine or redefine how we wear athletic inspired pieces its bold its playful and and in my opinion it can be undeniably chic just ask princess diana she always did it so well our eighth trend for is one that truly makes my heart swoon and that is ladylike dressing whats even better is that its a big nod to last year too meaning that all of those timeless feminine pieces like our cropped jackets for example in our wardrobe will continue to work hard for us for another year harpers bazaar points out this trend very demure a throwback to with classic touches like bow tie blouses peter pan collars pleated skirts and car coats the best though slightly subverted for a modern edge designers like jill sander blen siaga and chanel are showcasing that looks with elegance and a dash of playfulness are definitely all systems go for refiner ties this trend into the concept of quiet luxury with caplets draped silhouettes and refined outerwear really leading the charge chanel offers a whims ic spin with superhero inspired neck ties im all in for the silk neck tie this year what i love about ladylike dressing is how it makes me feel very jure tailoring for feminine outerwear these pieces bring a sense of polish and elegance that feel just so right for and the best part many of these pieces are staples that can be styled season after season making them a true wardrobe investment were also seeing a softening in tailoring which definitely deserves a trans spotlight of its own but for now ill just leave it that ladylike dressing is here to stay offering us a timeless silhouette with enough modern flare that it feels fresh and exciting for the year ahead so as alluded to our ninth trend for it takes a more relaxed refined approach to a structured style and that is soft dressing and tailoring tailoring is always kind of a trend topic this is where high fashion meets comfort and is blended with flowing fabrics feminine draping and slouchy sil et into what i like to really call soft power dressing harpers bazaar highlighted that forwardfacing hemlines flowing trains layers of chiffon and that demure yet subverted design i think peter pan collars at prada bowai blouses tied with lace at blen siaga and jonathan andersons light as a floral fabrics transformed into whimsical hoop skirts all different forms of tailoring and on the other side of the spectrum we are also seeing very specific tailoring take a softer turn after seasons of that sharp androgynous style refinery described this beautifully salem rots billowing oversized suits leading the charge and then designers like dzan nton and stella mccartney following suit pun intended think slouchy trousers silken suit shorts and lapels that remain structured but also pair seamlessly with drapey flowy bottoms this trend is really about balance finding that balance the flowy feminine fabric meeting the structured elements to create that look that feels powerful yet approachable whether youre leaning into chiffon layers or embracing oversized tailoring this trend offers a perfect blend of softness and sophistication and i think this is going to be big this year whether people know that theyre doing it or not these pieces arent just for the runway theyre designed to move to flow to adapt to bring real life and to bring a sense of and elegance again into everyday dressing which has kind of seemed to be a thread throughout of all of these trends for we are at trend number that is wallpaper nostalgic florals yes florals for spring its classic it comes back year after year but were throwing back to something a little bit more nostalgic almost as if these prints were plucked straight from s wallpaper its soft its romantic and its just a little bit retro harpers bizar described the runways as blooming with bouquets this season with every type of floral print that you can imagine lev and prada showcased dreamy light florals while chloe embraced a garden party of mixed patterns that felt straight out of the english country side as if i couldnt love chloe more mary cla really took that vintage angle calling these wallpaper florals which is where i kind of got the title for this one reminiscent of your great aunts s living room we are seeing these retro blooms dangling from dresses at bga vanetta clashing in separates at versace and flowing down slinky spaghetti strappy dresses at prada and at cosmopolitan they leaned more into the romance of it all connecting this trend with the whimsical fantasy romantic inspired aesthetic romany with sheer fabrics that really compliment that major main character in a romance novel vibe we used to call it bridgerton core but i think its just our fantasy selves wanting to break free this year what i love about this nostalgic twist on florals is how everyone can do it you can go full vintage clashing separates or opt for something thats a little bit softer and romantic like a slinky floral dress either way its a trend thats grounded in the past but definitely feels incredibly fresh for so my challenge this year is to dive into some florals that may be outside of my norm are we going to be channeling the s wallpaper aesthetic are we going to be going more whimsical soft fantasy main character vibes nostalgic florals are definitely a trend that promis to keep blooming all year long okay we only have two left trend number is fringe and frill aka embellishments if theres one thing i know that we love in fashion its movement its texture and its just to be here for a little something extra this year embellishments are definitely taking the main stage angelic ruffle bold fringe and everything in between harpers bizaar beautifully describes this trend as the thrill for frill ruffles are adding an airy effortless drape to skirts and dresses creating soft angelic movement that feels ethereal yet modern its designers like nicolo pascetti and ny doa that captured this so perfectly with flowy delicate designs but its not just about ruffles refiner calls this season a celebration of all of the akuta designers like nicolas jier at louis vuitton embraced a maximalist philosophy think bose brocade jackets jeweled tops and layers of sparkles its a direct challenge to quiet luxury where more is definitely more and i really just think that this is the fashion gods giving us permission to style anything the way that we want to style it embrace all of the personal expression and theres also a fringe frenzy going on which mary cla highlighted as the major player on the spring runways fringe transformed basic silhouettes into head turning statement pieces at prada bga vanetta famo and pruna schooler from leather fringe skirts to full fringe dresses these embellishments are all about texture drama and movement what i love most about this trend is just how fun it can be you can lean into a soft romantic ruffle a feminine vibe or embrace a bold fringe with movement in texture or go all out with your maximalist embellishment for a glamorous mo is more look sorry quiet luxury but were bringing back the excitement and the energy to our wardrobes for and the only rule is that there are no rules so mix match and layer to your hearts content and now we did it lets finish strong with trend number and that is the color palette if youve been here before you know i love talking about color trends they are always one of my favorite topics to cover in these videos because truly anyone can do it and and this year im planning a full video dedicated to color palettes in but i couldnt resist sharing the two standout trends that were mentioned in these articles and i think youre going to really like them so lets dive right in the first up is baby pink so say goodbye to barbie cores a vibrant pink and say hello to something thats softer calmer and definitely more sophisticated designers like brandon maxwell jason woo and air d theyre all embracing blush tones that are reminiscent of ballet slippers whether its an e theal sheer dress a sleek tailored suit its that refined take on pink that feels more timeless and definitely more wearable for everyone even those who may shy away from a full head to toe bubblegum look and next we have a twist on the neutrals and this one has been stealing my heart and the hearts of many without even realizing refiner is calling it the new neutrals and this trend really shakes up the traditional classic wardrobe of black and white and navy and camel its introducing earth tones in rich camels buttery yellows deep chocolate browns and even burgundy this fall it was one of the favorite hues and it continues to be throughout the winter months its a warm luxurious take on neutrals that feel perfect for winter and even into your spring wardrobes at ares camels are stepping back into where creams and blacks used to dominate while bga vanetta and tibby are adding a saturated wine red to dresses and blazers max mara always a time brand meanwhile is leaning into chocolate browns and khakis giving us an earthy tone the tone that we just didnt know we needed and for a modern twist

DCde2r_N2TU,fashion trends why you should care about them if youre over,most of us are kind of already doing this but okay we can be on trend i will take that hey everyone first of all happy new year welcome back to my channel i thought itd be fun to start off with a bang with one of my favorite videos now i do about four of these a year the seasonal trend videos what we can expect to see in the coming season what i think is wearable what im not all that excited about for the first time on my channel i decided to look at some of the overarching trends for all four seasons that the experts are telling us are in for and as a woman over i want to explain why it is important for all of us my age and older to still be up to date on the trends and look at them and adapt them into our own wardrobes when applicable okay here comes the lecture part of this video maybe even a little bit of a rant but stick with me here i truly believe that how we feel about how we look on the outside absolutely affects the inside this isnt about looking good to impress other people honestly you should be trying to impress yourself every day the reverse holds true for me if i dont feel really well if im really dragging like right this moment actually all i want to do is wash my face and lay down on the couch so what did i do i did my hair i put on a lot more makeup and im trying to make the outside match well i should say im trying to make my inside now match my outside for me its important especially as we get older especially as we have more health concerns i think it is important to still want to look and feel our best and that means maybe staying on top of the trends trying to stay up toate while adapting them to make ourselves feel good about wearing them so am i saying that you should run out and do all the trends that the yearolds and y olds and teenagers are doing no but there are ways that we can pick and choose that can alen things up a little bit break up a little bit of the monotony of our closet and just have fun because what else are we doing here so i have five trends to talk about with you today and to make this helpful for you i am giving shoppable examples of how you can wear these pieces now bring them into your wardrobe and i will list all the trends and all the products mentioned down in the description box pin it to the top of the comment section and if its available on youtube shopping tag it there as well where it says view products or something like that im going to share a variety of pictures some ive pulled from pinterest some are the shoppable pieces so if its a shoppable piece ill have it numbered and that number will correspond down in the description box and all the other places as well okay rant and lecture over lets start with the first trend for and those are the colors of the year so every year pantone decides what the color of the year is going to be and this year it is mocha moose which is like cool tone brown and we saw hints of this coming through id say about midye in fact i have this outfit one of my faves for that is hands down the perfect example of mocha moous according to walmart that color is called mushroom but along with mocha moous earth tones like olive clay sand rust and brown which were gaining momentum at the end of are definitely pushing through all the way through so you will see that not just for fall colors but right now in winter and then pushing through into spring summer etc another color to keep your eye out for is the soft ballet pink the blush along with a few other soft pastels i think this is sort of of an extension of the barbie pink thing that was happening last year and now theyre fading into pastels and soft and airy and again not just for spring but carried all through the year and then another big color is deep reds again not new weve seen this especially in the fall i saw this a lot in like deep cherries and burgundies and bordeau in handbags especially in nail polish in tights and in all kinds of clothes so what are some examples of how you could actually wear these in your wardrobe well first of all pick and choose if you look like roadkill in pastels or washed out in mocha mose dont wear them maybe relegate those to an accessory like a handbag a pair of earrings a pair of shoes something thats not close to your face and dont invest a lot of money in it or just skip it all together i did want to give you some actual concrete examples mocha mous can be tricky to wear so like i said maybe keep it away from your face if youre concerned it itll wash you out put it in your pants great way to do that is a wide leg pair of corduroy pants wide leg is another trend were going to talk about in a little bit so youre incorporating two trends in one this is very wearable pair corduroy is a little more casual so if you dont want to get fully dressed up into a pair of pants sort of same in the jeans category and these also do happen to come in a soft dusty pink so youre hitting two colors there i mentioned one of my favorite ath leisure looks of late is still going strong into this is from scoop its their drawring scuba jacket and the cargo the scuba cargo joggers they happen to come in this color they also happen to come in a lot of other colors theres a whole lot of pieces in this line all of them come in this mushroom shade and then brand new for and i just ordered this and will be coming up in a haul is this jumpsuit scu in it as well and if this looks a lot to you like the spanx air essentials jumpsuit you are correct it looks a lot like that to me too now pinks can be tricky some of us look better in the soft pastel pink some of us prefer the pink so if you want to embrace the pink and youre afraid you put it in a pair of shoes in a skirt or whatever but i really love this batwing sweater it is actually trending and as the number one sweater on the amazon platform obviously because its amazon its going to come in a ton of colors but this soft pink is beautiful also this cashmere tshirt if you are new here one of my alltime favorite retailers that i really got into in was quint and when i say affordable cashmere im aware that for a tshirt is not considered affordable but if you think about the fact that its made out of cashmere and cashmere is usually a rather unattainable fabric for this is fantastic so i actually have this in a couple of colors i dont have it in the baby pink but its just under so i think thats a fantastic price if you want to keep things a little more casual this is a more sort of an apricot peachy shade not quite pink but close back to that scuba line from walmart again and then the last pink example is this frank and eileene inspired quarter zip sort of net sweater frank and eileen is i wouldnt call it a luxury brand but is definitely highend i think this particular sweater from the original line is over this one is and youre going to see this everywhere its been around for a little bit but its gaining momentum and a lot of retailers are pulling out their versions of it more affordable dupe if you will and i love that this one is in a nice pink color and then a handful of cherry sl burgundy examples first of all and i should have led with this you could do nail polish thats an easy way to try it out so pink nail polish even the mocha moous and a burgundy they could look beautiful just depends on your skin tone and if youre not sure put it on your toes but some cherry burgundy examples this beautiful chenille sweater it actually has a little checkerboard pattern so you kind of have some texture going there as well then this polo stripe sweater has the beautiful sort of deep red stripes across that and it also is another theme were seeing in which is strip stripes and the fisherman aesthetic well get into that in a moment this ribbed sweater is originally i think inspired by something that anthropology used to carry and may carry from time to time i actually have this exact sweater in a beautiful emerald green but it also comes in this beautiful burgundy deep red shade and then i have to give another shout out to quint they make the most luscious washable silk pieces and im not when i say washable its silk that you can throw in your washing machine on the cold gentle cycle and then you know hang to dry so this silk blouse i actually have its gorgeous and its just easy to wear now layered under a cardigan or a sweater works really well in spring fall even summer if youre working inside and its air conditioned okay i have so much to say and we only got through one trend so maybe i wont walk you through each piece ill just stick them up and number them and then you can go down into the description box and if you want to know more about a specific piece just ask me in the comments cuz i know you all are busy its the beginning of the year you have to do so lets get to trend number two which is not just athleisure which i am embracing and have done for a while its called athleisure mix and match so the idea here is to take your athleisure pieces and separate them so maybe dont wear the matching track pants or the matching wid leg pants or joggers that come with this pair them with a pair of jeans a nicer pair of pants or a skirt or maybe wear the track pants and pair it with a nicer sweater or a blouse so were mixing and matching athleisure with our reg regular clothing maybe a hoodie and sneakers to kind of tie in the full effect so its that kind of street style casual im not really trying hard but you actually had to try a little bit to figure out how to pair all these things up youre probably already doing it to some extent and that is another thing ive noticed with a lot of these trends most of us are kind of already doing this but okay we can be on trend i will take that when were wearing atleisure were usually buying a twopiece set and thats easy its like a granimal for adults we dont have to think about it we just put it on but when you have to start pulling it apart and mixing and matching it makes it a little bit trickier so my advice on this trend is to stick with the monochromatic look so if youre going with navy track pants with maybe a white stripe down the side get a navy sweater or navy blouse keep it all in the same color family so an example of this monochromatic look is something that i think also looks really elegant even though its not half f leisure a very basic white or cream sweater like the one i have on with a pair of wider leg cargo nit pants has an athleisure feel to it especially because of the fabric pair it with some tone onone loafers or if you really want to embrace the athleisure end some sneakers its a look or maybe you take this twopiece set that is another frank and eileen inspired set very popular one of the best sellers from last month on my channel and you take just the top which feels very loungewear very at leisure and you pair it with a pair of crepe pleated pants or the nonpleated version so its a much more modern take a couple other places that i would look especially is athleta as a retailer they have two pairs of pants that feel more like athleisure because of the material and theyre a pullon style but theyre a little more tailored and theyre going to work really well in pulling together all of the athleisure looks that youre going to want to wear going through especially right now and the nice thing about athleta is that they are constantly having sales so look to shop at athleta on a weekend thats more likely when theyre going to have their sales trend number three i feel like these people are going all right were going to show the same stuff but but we need to give it a different name so people think its new so were calling this fisherman aesthetic this is the fisherman aesthetic that i think of when i hear that phrase this is a recycling of last years coastal grandma but for those of us who are grownups in the room this is just nautical inspired so how do you wear this its cable knit sweaters obviously right now and then short sleeve cable knit sweaters when it gets warmed its boat neck teas its lots of navies and regular blues and reds and whites its a lot of americana type stuff were going to see a resurgence in boat shoes more knits lots of stripes couple retailers i want to point out that have been doing this for years and doing it well j crew and j crew factory talbots those are some classic retailers theyve been around forever that are always showing this stuff chicos just put out an entire nautical themed line that they just released this january but a few key pieces i just want to point out youre going to want some sort of fishermans sweater so a couple of examples i have this ones a little pricier its cashmere though and its a vneck cardigan so i feel like its a little more versatile and that you comp paare it with a bunch of different things you can even drape it over your shoulders in spring summer fall so you can wear it a lot longer or you can go with this mach neck cable knit sweater it also comes in red green blue beige i mean just so many options and that one is under i do want to point out example of a boat shoe not the biggest fan of the boat shoe it can look really heavy and clunky on the feet but im loving it in a silver soft silver metallic and steve madden just released this one and then if you want a super budget friendly option i found one at walmart for you too trend number four we need to talk about pants or bottoms and according to quite a few sites who have been deemed expert in their field hot pants are in and i am not talking about like little short shorts im talking about you essentially wearing underwear in public and i dont think i need to tell you that its a pass for me its a hard note pretty sure everyone watching this also a hard not unless you are in a pool or at the beach so that one im not even going to try to attempt to adapt it for my style its just its not going to happen but some other things we need to talk about is that even though i have been hearing rumblings that skinny jeans are making a comeback that is not what im seeing on the retailers websites and not what im seeing in all the articles that have been written up so what we are seeing is wide leg not new sought last year carrying through especially the barrel leg option which i have to say i think it looks like everyone wearing them has rickets or some sort of nutritional deficiency but if you want something thats actually wearable try widel leg jeans wideleg trousers and you dont need to go for the exaggerated wide leg a slimmer wide leg which i know is an oxymoron is i think a lot more wearable and a lot more sustainable itll itll outlast whatever trend is happening in couple of ones i just want to point out these patch pocket jeans this has been popular for about a year and a half still going strong this is a much more affordable option than anything else that i have found my favorite pair of trouser jeans of all time are these i have them in every color theyve ever released they hold up beautifully and theyre not an exaggerated wide leg so theyre very very wearable and then were back to quinns and they just released these highrise wideleg jeans theyre and their jeans are incredible i will tell you this with all the quin dream ive tried size up one from whatever size the size chart tells you you will love these these are lifechanging and if youre more of a p ps person and i know there are a few of you here that feel very strongly about that try these i believe is it ponty knit ive heard people say p ponty is how i would say it these wideleg pants under they do come i believe in navy and black as well this is an allseason wear kind of pant very beautiful and i believe it comes in a couple of inseam lengths as well and then the last trend i want to talk about are patterns for so ive already touched on stripes stripes fits very neatly into the whole what are we calling it fisherman aesthetic i just want to call it nautical can we not just call it what it is anyway so stripes of all kinds more horizontal than vertical but i do want to point out that this button front blouse has stripes comes in a ton of colors you could probably find it in deep burgundy soft pink some nautical inspired themes one of my most worn pieces and its visos blend so its very travel friendly does not wrinkle super lightweight i adore it so i wanted to give you that but a couple of other patterns that are allegedly big for polka dots now polka dots can go really juvenile really quickly and they can also overwhelm a smaller frame and on a larger frame person can look just ridiculous so when and doubt dont go for the super super big ones you go for almost like a micro dot pattern so its hard to tell what youre really looking at i think the most beautiful and most elegant and most grownup way to wear polka dots is in a shirt dress thats the most classic style that i have seen so i know this is a higher price point but when i saw this on the nordstrom website i just went its beautiful its a crepe to sheen dress from ralph lauren this is a classic polka dot style it is not a new style by any means weve all seen this dress before it is just seeing a comeback and i love it target has this maxi skirt in polka dot version this ones a little trickier the dots are a little bit bigger but if you want to go bold this ones a try and if you want something super subtle try polka dot sheer tights tiny little dots on there right now this time of year are great great way to add something of interest to your legs add a layer of warmth i actually just picked up a link it this pair of fleece line tights so they look like sheer tights but theyre actually lined with skin tone colored fleece its a fun way to just pair it with like a maybe even a shorter black skirt black sweater youve got polka dots youre untrendy warm you dont have to shave your legs your skin tone looks amazing were checking a bunch of boxes and then the last big pattern for are animal prints not just leopard leopard is still leopard sl cheetah still huge abs absolutely huge but also you ready for this one tiger zebra and my favorite cow i dont know what woman wants to be called a cow let alone wear cow prints so that one im not going to recommend if you love cow prints you go for it you rock it these are my opinions but i want you to have fun im having fun making this video i have fun when i get dressed more often than not i want you to have fun so if im poo pooing a trend that you love you go for it i mean thats the fun of all of this but for me its a hard pass on the cow thing the only cow pattern i have in my house is an actual cow hide as a rug in the on the floor of my husbands study so its a no for me tiger i think a cool way to to incorporate any of the animal prints other than cow into your wardrobe if youre like i dont know is again with your shoes a belt or a scarf so i found a really cool featherweight cashmere scarf and its a tiger stripe and its subtle and its just you know you wrap around your neck or you drape it around you its another layer it can be worn through the year you could drape it over your spaghetti strap dress to a wedding that you might have in the summer or you could wear it now for warmth thats the beauty of the featherweight another great version are these rothy shoes i know these are a pretty high price point i have them in the leopard print my recommendation on those is size up a half size i am not a print person and i find those are the easiest way for me to just kind of punch up an outfit just a little bit and those happen to be super comfortable i do have a very similar amazon version in a solid taupe but they do have it in the uh leopard they have a few leopard prints so i wanted to link that and then if youre wearing like mostly black or mostly neutrals belts ive mentioned are pretty big right now and the leopard belt i used to have one i mean most of us probably already have a lot of this in our closet which is pretty cool pull it out because its back im thinking even for summer like a really nice shamur button front top pair of white jeans and a tiger print like a skinny tiger or leopard print belt leopard print shoes its kind of a cool look there so thats my take on just a few of the fashion trends for i will break these down much more specifically with more concrete examples as we get into each specific season so if youre not already subscribed and youre looking forward to hearing what i have to say specifically about spring make sure you hit that subscribe button cuz well be hitting that probably late february early march so you are well prepared for shopping come springtime until then i hope you had fun with this one i really did dont take anything too seriously just get dressed and i will see you

GFHf3cPCxXk,top wearable fashion trends how to wear them,hello my darlings welcome back to the youtube channel today im going to be sharing the top most wearable trends for and how to wear them im also going to be sharing a really weird trend that i cannot believe has come back in fashion as well as a shoe trend that i have not worn in over years i would love to know if you guys are going to be wearing these trends let me know down below if you are new to the channel then hello and welcome my name is josie i have been doing these trend videos for coming up years here on youtube and its becoming more and more ironic because i would say that my style is becoming less and less trend le and a lot more timeless and classic but i still love to know what the trends are just so that i can subtly incorporate them into my outfits whether its with things that ive already owned for or so years or whether its that high street piece that will really elevate so many of my outfits for the coming season or in this case the coming year if you are new to my channel i usually share vlogs here on the channel so daily vlogs of our life here in the cworld and i would love for you to join me so if you are new and that sounds like the kind of video that you will enjoy watching then hit the subscribe button down below and if you enjoy this video a thumbs up goes a really long way so thank you so much okay lets get started with trend number one as i said these are the most wearable trends for if a trend is not wearable quite honestly i dont want to know about it it doesnt interest me because i want everything in my wardrobe to be versatile wearable comfortable and i love to get my price per wear so the first trend is elevated basics we have seen so many basics on the runway for the past few years and in theyre just taken up a notch whether thats with the fabric were seeing a lot of things like tank tops in beautiful silky fabrics were seeing shirts with that little bit of extra detail i love the fact that this is such a wearable trend because we all need basics in our wardrobe in fact what im wearing right now essentially is just a tank top but in this lovely cashmere fabric it just takes it up that little level and helps to elevate an entire outfit lets talk about denim im actually not the biggest wearer of denim i find jeans really uncomfortable and it seems that i am alone because most people in the world love to wear jeans on a regular sl daily basis so i do like to make sure that i am aware of what the denim styles are in we saw the horseshoe or barrel leg jean becoming really fashionable and i actually slated that as a trend that i would be not enticed to wear in the slightest but as i thought it might do the more and more i saw it the more i thought maybe i could wear it and you know what actually made me want to try it was kira nightly in black doves she just made them look so fabulous with her teeny weeny little waist and then the horseshoe trousers i thought the silhouette was really flattering and i think that is going to continue this year i still have not invested in any barrel or horseshoe shaped trousers let me know if you have down below but im incredibly happy to report that the one denim style that i do like which is the wideleg trouser is going to continue to be really on trend in im also really happy to see that white and a crew bone green color trousers are going to be the number one colorway for denim this year and that is going to be especially popular in spring i find that bright white jeans are a little bit less wearable not just because i live in the countryside and i get soil and dirt and dog muddy pores on absolutely everything but bright white jeans they are going to be a little bit of a micr trend i have got some lovely ones which are slightly more on a joda style which i think look really nice when worn with riding style boots i dont ride horses but i love the riding aesthetic so that is one way that i will be wearing bright white jeans and the debate of skinny jeans versus wideleg jeans just goes on and on and honestly its whatever you feel comfortable in personally when it comes to skinny jeans i like to wear them with boots otherwise i do find that they can look a little bit dated but i would say that the slim straight is a really nice in between so its fitted on the waist fitted on the thighs but theyre not quite so skinny on the ankle they go into a little bit of a drain pipe so the slim straight is going to be a really nice way of getting the look of skinny jeans but really modernizing them into a way that is fashionable and yet still wearable for on the runways we saw a lot of sheer clothing so i think this is going to be a trend that continues into we saw it on the runways for prada and mes they did sheer trousers which i didnt think that i would love but actually i really liked how they looked on the catwalk and i think were going to be seeing a lot of sheer elements coming into outfits in fact you know you really love something when you buy it in multiple colors i have got this blouse in cream which is currently in the wash because i wore it at christmas and also in this brown color an element of sheer such as a sheer sleeve i think is going to be the most wearable way of wearing the sheer trend this year by the way i should have mentioned anything that im wearing or showing in the video is going to be linked in the description box down bel from my outfit to my jewelry the jewelry trends this year are very much anything goes big bold jewelry was very visible across the catwalks but i have to say im still more of a dainty jewelry kind of person thats the thing about these trends you can pick and choose and as long as you wear them with confidence i know that sounds really really cheesy but no no one is ever going to look at you and think oh my goodness that girl is so not on trend i mean at least at least i hope no ones going to do that no one that i know would ever be that cruel i think as long as you wear something that you love and you feel confident in it then youre going to look fabulous and i know its cringe and it sounds so so cheesy but wearing things with confidence has to be the most fashionable thing in and always but yes jewelry that was a digression jewelry i would say that mixed metals are coming back into trend i do wear mixed metals ive got mostly yellow gold but my wedding ring is is still dont even know if its white gold or platinum but its certainly not gold my watch is a rose color got gold earrings i think dainty and feminine pieces are always going to be on trend but like we saw five or six years ago big bold jewelry is definitely coming back for i do have the pleasure throughout the years of working with a lot of jewelry brands from monica viner to majuri and i very often have discount codes some of them are always on for example monica viner josie mv its an always on discount code and i do have a discount directory on my blog my website which ill leave at the very top of the description box because for so many fashion beauty and even home brands i have amazing discount codes that you might as well make the most of so just have a little look at my discount directory which will be linked down below and you can bookmark it for any future purchases so another really big trend that we saw on the catwalk for is maximalist fashion ive heard a few people say that quiet luxury is out and loud luxury is in im not so sure about that but we saw brands such as s lon prada mes ralph la in fact everybody was doing big bold colors bold patterns whether it was really obvious leopard print or bright yellow bright green neon shoes just things that make a statement are going to be really in for with a lot of these trends the way that i like to make them wearable is if im unsure first of all go to the high street dont go spending hundreds or thousands of pounds on something thats on trend if youre not sure if youre going to absolutely love it wait until youve worn it times before investing in the higher price version if thats something you decide to do but also i like to integrate them in bitesize amounts so often it might be with an accessory such as a pair of shoes or a hbag especially with trends that are a little bit more out there and away from my comfort zone i also love to integrate trends by combining them with something that im already familiar with so take for example the suede trend which is actually not going anywhere it was huge for autumn winter it is not going anywhere for so if you did invest in suede youre in luck because its still very much on trend but equally one of those things that never really goes out of fashion so its a trend that youre quite safe at investing with but say its something that you want to take part in but youre not sure how think of something that youre already really comfortable with perhaps its a blazer or a hobo style relaxed shape bag that is the kind of item that you already know how to style so therefore you could look to a more on trend fabric such as a suede blazer or a suede is it hobo or boho you guys know what i mean and that i find is a really wearable way of integrating trends in a way that you can instantly feel comfortable in so i actually did invest in the suede boho bag orobo of last year which is the s lon one right here you can really fill this up and pack so much in i use it to take my laptop into london on those days i have actually been known to use it as my gym bag as well so im especially relieved to hear that this trend is continuing into but this bag also represents another trend which is boho styling i always love chloe for this particular trend i think that they do ruffles they do pleat they do draping fabric they do a romantic silhouette so so wonderfully well but also the high street always picks up on this trend really quickly well be seeing ruffles in zara and hm before we know it and the boho trend is one which i think is very very easy to do it could just be a simple ruffle at the color of the shirt that you wear to work every single le day it could be an asymmetric floating style hem in a skirt if thats more your vibe or it could be something as simple as adding a boho style bag into your outfit rotation suede and the boho trend really do go handin hand and another piece which i think were going to be seeing really becoming more and more on trend which i really hope because im wearing it literally right now is the suede midy skirt let me show you my skirt that im wearing right now i dont know if this will still be available still in stock oh my goodness ive not seen this one in a very long time um i got this one from me andm so it was a premium high street piece often if there is a piece which is on trend which i think fits my personal style really well there we go then i will look to the premium high street because then you get that beautiful quality the pieces feel like theyre made really well and they look fantastic and yet were not quite going up to that sometimes quite ridiculous designer price tag okay now if you do watch my vlogs youll know that i spend a lot of my life in the outfits that i wear to and from pilates so im thrilled to say that elevated sportsware is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger for we saw so many of the designer brands showcasing elevated sportsware and that manifested in loads of different ways one which i found really interesting and is such a throwback to my childhood growing up in herfordshire gluster shire surrounded by farmland essentially rugby shirts rugby shirts were what everyone wore when i was growing up both the girls the boys you know the star that i mean often jewels with the big kind of harle quinn style pattern on them or the big bold stripes theyre coming into fashion and its just something that i never ever would have predicted but im quite happy about it because boy oh boy do i have a lot of rugby shirts in my wardrobe were also seeing the elevated polo shirt this i would say is one of the biggest trends from for and it has most definitely stemmed from that elevated sports wear the likes of tommy hilfiger ralph lauren they are going to be absolutely thrilled but also holland cooper they have got some beautiful very wearable lovely fabric polo shirts which can be easily integrated into a smart or casual outfit either worn with your ac crew highwaisted jeans with a lovely belt or even with a skirt like im wearing right now its surprisingly easy to wear a polo shirt especially when is in a really lovely fabric and im sure the high street will definitely have so many options before we know it i do wonder if this trend kind of stems from lvmh being one of the main sponsors of the olympics last year but sportsware has really gone beyond what i ever could have imagined when it comes to inspiring the trends that were seeing were seeing a lot of nods to even more kind of motorsport style racing ive seen brands with faux sponsorship logos all over their shirts like love peace as though its castol oil anyone that watches formula will know exactly what im talking about with these big sponsorship style logos were seeing racing stripes oh my goodness dior put that checkerboard sl rcing stripe on so many things from bags to skirts to boots not sure how i feel about that one i would say that thats probably a trend that i would look to the high street if i did want to take part in it which i dont think i do but if you are very sporty then i think it is an incredibly weable trend were also seeing a lot of elevated bomber jackets and yeah these are quite wearable especially if you walk to work or you need something practical for the school run then sporty bomber jackets could be something that you get a lot of price per wear out of and really tick that elevated sportsare trend ill just quickly mention a couple of shoe trends both of which i dont really like to be honest which is a shame um so i dont know why im including them in my top most wearable trends but ill let you know about them anyway number one sadly we are seeing the return of perspect shoes yeah not too sure about that one for me perspect shoes just mean pain and condensation i did invest in the mac and mac shoes many years ago when were these on trend like three or four years ago that have got the perspect bit at the bottom and this is the only pair of perspect shoes that i own let me tell you they are ridiculously uncomfortable and theres nothing sexy about about seeing peoples toes we are not is it only feet is that the website i dont know im im not selling pictures of my toes to anybody and no one needs to see them so yeah i think that perspect shoes we saw i think it was chloe which seems like such an unlo thing to do that had perspect bright pink wedge cork style shoes not wearable in my opinion and the second shoe style which is having a comeback which i would definitely be more tempted with this one than with perspect shoes is peeptoe shoes this is the one that i have not thought about i dont even think in years since i was in my teenage years peep toe shoes you know the style that how literally you just see your big toe sticking out im not sure if i definitely wont be spending a lot of money on this style of shoe but if i see an affordable pair thats really cute and they do become the shoe star of the summer then that would be the shoe trend that i would be slightly more inclined to try out just one more super quick shoe trend to mention and it is the basic flipflop we have seen havana have a moment of glory once again i like the fact that they have been making their flipflops a little bit more trendy with a square toe or a coffin shaped toe and i think whether people are jetting off for some winter sun or getting their feet out early when the sun finally decides to grace us with its presence basic flipflops i think is something were going to be seeing a lot of instantly springing to mind is lucy williams and her trips to greece at the end of last summer i think we saw a lot of basic style flipflops on those very kind of fashion style girls at the end of last summer so well be seeing a lot more of that coming into now i am always thrilled to hear when feminine romantic fashion that comes back on trend for many years i used to create a romantic lookbook here on youtube if youve been watching my channel for long enough to remember the romantic look books then uh please let me know down below i used to do entire dedicated high production videos on super feminine romantic designs featuring ruffles lace frill and all of those things are coming back into fashion which im absolutely thrilled about the way that ill be making those design details a lot more wearable for is maybe just muting back the colors now that i live in the countryside and not in london unfortunately pink ruffle dresses they just they just dont hit quite the same when im trudging through fields most of the time so i recently invested in this little beauty which i know doesnt look that romantic but ladylike boxy jackets and cardigans are a really wonderful way of wearing that trend you can wear them properly buttoned up but we all know that the fashion girls on instagram are going to be wearing them just casually slung over their shoulders which let me tell you its just so unpractical but it does look undeniably chic its a great way of smartening up an outfit as well and its not just by the way this is brown not black if you have watched my videos for a while youll know that i barely own anything black and really find it almost impossible to wear maybe ill do a color analysis to find out what my psychological issue with wearing black is um but brown i find incredibly wearable but i think in spring well see a lot more creams maybe with some beautiful gold threads running through lots of bay when it comes to these lovely jackets and cardigans as well okay the color on my camera is doing something a little bit strange but speaking of color the color trend that is going to be really big for is butter yellow which i am thrilled about i think butter yellow is such a wearable trend i had the most beautiful outfit if i can find a photo ill pop it on the screen here that i wore quite a lot at the end of summer last year i think both the skirt and the cardigan were from hob and its the kind of color that really just makes you look healthy it makes you look well i think it suits all hair colors all skin tones its a universally flattering color depending on your hair and your skin tone maybe you want to lean slightly warmer towards those mustardy almost kind of you put a little bit of saffron in with your risoto kind of yellow um but then if you are slightly paler maybe blonder then the lighter milkier buttery tones i think are just so so flattering so find a yellow that suits your skin tone literally just hold things up and see which which tone illuminates and gives your face the best glow thats how you know what what colors work for you but yellow is going to be a huge one for which im really really happy about ill definitely be wearing that outfit on repeat so what is the weird trend that i think is completely unwearable but im willing to be proved wrong for its a real marmite one ive heard people saying that they love it and theyve been doing it for years and theyre so happy its finally on trend but mostly ive heard people saying not going to be wearing that im in the latter camp and it is possibly a word that youve never even heard of before the scant s a n t the scant you guessed it it is the skirt pant that sounds quite american so i guess in the uk well be calling it the scouser skirt trouser ive seen it in denim ive seen in block colors ive seen it in cottons a little ruffly skirt over the top of trousers i think it just looks weird if i turned up to a work event wearing something like that i honestly think most people would be like what what what is she doing and i also think with these trend pieces if its the kind of thing that if you wear it over to your granddads house and hes like what you what are you wearing darling then its probably not the most wearable or longlasting trend so something that im likely to skip and leave to the fashionistas weve got fashion week coming up in february not something i partake in any longer but something that i still enjoy watching and absorbing even if it is just to have um a little smile as to what people are wearing but id love to know my darlings what are you excited to wear in do you also just like to know about the trends so that youre aware of them and maybe its slightly influences your outfit or do you like to go all out and ensure that you are always bang on trend theres no right or wrong way to do anything as long as you love what you wear then youre doing it perfectly so if you enjoyed todays video dont forget to give it a thumbs up if you are subscribing to the channel as little fyi im going to be doing just two videos a week in january it is my slightly more relaxed month and then well be back up to the three vlogs a week when we are back in february so well have fashion videos like this on sundays and vlogs on wednesdays throughout january and then in february back to the usual tuesday thursday sunday routine so thank you so much for joining me if you enjoyed the video you know what to do and ill see you in the next one bye music music
4RixMPF4xis,ai vs machine learning,artificial intelligence and machine learning whats the difference are they the same well some people kind of frame the question this way its ai versus ml is that the right way to think of this or is it ai equals ml or is it ai is somehow something different than ml so heres three equations i wonder which one is going to be right well lets talk about this first of all when we talk about ai i think its important to come with definitions because a lot of people have different ideas of what this is so im going to assert the simple definition that ai is basically exceeding or matching the capabilities of a human so were trying to match the intelligence whatever that means and capabilities of a human subject now what could that involve theres a number of different things for instance one of them is the ability to discover to find out new information another is the ability to infer to read in information from other sources that maybe has not been explicitly stated and then also the ability to reason the ability to figure things out i put this and this together and i come up with something else so im going to suggest to you this is what ai is and thats the definition well use for this discussion now what kinds of things then would be involved if we were talking about doing machine learning well machine learning im going to put that over here is basically a capability well start with a venn diagram machine learning involves predictions or decisions based on data think about this as a very sophisticated form of statistical analysis its looking for predictions based upon information that we have so the more we feed into the system the more its able to give us accurate predictions and decisions based upon that data its something that learns thats the l part rather than having to be programmed when we program a system i have to come up with all the code and if i wanted to do something different i have to go change the code and then get a different outcome in the machine learning situation what im doing could be adjusting some models but is different than programming and mostly its learning the more data that i give to it so its based on large amounts of information and theres a couple of different fields within couple of different types there is supervised machine learning and as you might guess theres an unsupervised machine learning and the main difference as the name implies is one has more human oversight looking at the training of the data using labels that are superimposed on the data unsupervised is kind of able to run more uh and and find things that were not explicitly stated okay so thats machine learning it turns out that theres a subfield of machine learning that we call deep learning and what is deep learning well this involves things like neural networks neural networks involve nodes and statistical relationships between those nodes to model the way that our minds work and its called deep because were doing multiple layers of those neural networks now the interesting thing about deep learning is we can end up with some very interesting insights but we might not always be able to tell how the system came up with that it doesnt always show its work fully so we could end up with some really interesting information not know in some cases how reliable that is because we dont know exactly how it was derived but its still a very important part of all of this realm that were dealing with so those are two areas and you can see dl is a subset of ml but what about artificial intelligence where does that fit in the venn diagram and im going to suggest to you it is the superset of mldl and a bunch of other things what could the other of things be well we can involve things like natural language processing uh it could be vision so we want a system thats able to see we might even want a system thats able to hear and be able to distinguish what its hearing and what its seeing because after all humans are able to do that and thats part of what our brains do is distinguish those kinds of things it can involve other things like the ability to do text to speech so if we take written words concepts and be able to speak those out so this first one involved being able to see things this is now being able to speak those things as well and then other things that humans are able to do naturally that we often take for granted is motion this is the field of robotics which is a subset of ai the ability to just do simple things like tie our shoes open and close the door lift something walk somewhere thats all something that would be part of human capabilities and involves certain sorts of perceptions calculations that we do in our brains that we dont even think about so heres what it comes down to its a venn diagram and weve got machine learning weve got deep learning and weve got ai so im going to suggest to you the right way to think about this is not these equations those are not the way to look at it in fact what we should think about this as machine learning is a subset of a high and thats how we need to think about this when im doing machine learning in fact i am doing ai when im doing these other things im doing ai but none of them are all of ai but theyre a very important part thanks for watching please remember to like this video and subscribe

ukzFI9rgwfU,machine learning what is machine learning introduction to machine learning simplilearn,we know humans learn from their past experiences and machines follow instructions given by humans but what if humans can train the machines to learn from the past data and do what humans can do and much faster well thats called machine learning but its a lot more than just learning its also about understanding and reasoning so today we will learn about the basics of machine learning so thats paul he loves listening to new songs he either likes them or dislikes them paul decides this on the basis of the songs tempo genre intensity and the gender of voice for simplicity lets just use tempo and intensity for now so here tempo is on the x axis ranging from relaxed to fast whereas intensity is on the y axis ranging from light to soaring we see that paul likes the song with fast tempo and soaring intensity while he dislikes the song with relaxed tempo and light intensity so now we know pauls choices lets say paul listens to a new song lets name it as song a song a has fast tempo and a soaring intensity so it lies somewhere here looking at the data can you guess whether paul will like the song or not correct so paul likes this song by looking at pauls past choices we were able to classify the unknown song very easily right lets say now paul listens to a new song lets label it as song b so song b lies somewhere here with medium tempo and medium intensity neither relaxed nor fast neither light nor soaring now can you guess whether paul likes it or not not able to guess whether paul will like it or dislike it are the choices unclear correct we could easily classify song a but when the choice became complicated as in the case of song b yes and thats where machine learning comes in lets see how in the same example for song b if we draw a circle around the song b we see that there are four votes for like whereas one would for dislike if we go for the majority votes we can say that paul will definitely like the song thats all this was a basic machine learning algorithm also its called k nearest neighbors so this is just a small example in one of the many machine learning algorithms quite easy right believe me it is but what happens when the choices become complicated as in the case of song b thats when machine learning comes in it learns the data builds the prediction model and when the new data point comes in it can easily predict for it more the data better the model higher will be the accuracy there are many ways in which the machine learns it could be either supervised learning unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning lets first quickly understand supervised learning suppose your friend gives you one million coins of three different currencies say one rupee one euro and one dirham each coin has different weights for example a coin of one rupee weighs three grams one euro weighs seven grams and one dirham weighs four grams your model will predict the currency of the coin here your weight becomes the feature of coins while currency becomes the label when you feed this data to the machine learning model it learns which feature is associated with which label for example it will learn that if a coin is of grams it will be a rupee coin lets give a new coin to the machine on the basis of the weight of the new coin your model will predict the currency hence supervised learning uses labeled data to train the model here the machine knew the features of the object and also the labels associated with those features on this note lets move to unsupervised learning and see the difference suppose you have cricket data set of various players with their respective scores and wickets taken when you feed this data set to the machine the machine identifies the pattern of player performance so it plots this data with the respective wickets on the xaxis while runs on the yaxis while looking at the data youll clearly see that there are two clusters the one cluster are the players who scored higher runs and took less wickets while the other cluster is of the players who scored less runs but took many wickets so here we interpret these two clusters as batsmen and bowlers the important point to note here is that there were no labels of batsmen and bowlers hence the learning with unlabeled data is unsupervised learning so we saw supervised learning where the data was labeled and the unsupervised learning where the data was unlabeled and then there is reinforcement learning which is a reward based learning or we can say that it works on the principle of feedback here lets say you provide the system with an image of a dog and ask it to identify it the system identifies it as a cat so you give a negative feedback to the machine saying that its a dogs image the machine will learn from the feedback and finally if it comes across any other image of a dog it will be able to classify it correctly that is reinforcement learning to generalize machine learning model lets see a flowchart input is given to a machine learning model which then gives the output according to the algorithm applied if its right we take the output as a final result else we provide feedback to the training model and ask it to predict until it learns i hope youve understood supervised and unsupervised learning so lets have a quick quiz you have to determine whether the given scenarios uses supervised or unsupervised learning simple right scenario one facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs scenario netflix recommends new movies based on someones past movie choices scenario analyzing bank data for suspicious transactions and flagging the fraud transactions think wisely and comment below your answers moving on dont you sometimes wonder how is machine learning possible in todays era well thats because today we have humongous data available everybody is online either making a transaction or just surfing the internet and thats generating a huge amount of data every minute and that data my friend is the key to analysis also the memory handling capabilities of computers have largely increased which helps them to process such huge amount of data at hand without any delay and yes computers now have great computational powers so there are a lot of applications of machine learning out there to name a few machine learning is used in healthcare where diagnostics are predicted for doctors review the sentiment analysis that the tech giants are doing on social media is another interesting application of machine learning fraud detection in the finance sector and also to predict customer churn in the ecommerce sector while booking a gap you must have encountered surge pricing often where it says the fair of your trip has been updated continue booking yes please im getting late for office well thats an interesting machine learning model which is used by global taxi giant uber and others where they have differential pricing in real time based on demand the number of cars available bad weather rush r etc so they use the surge pricing model to ensure that those who need a cab can get one also it uses predictive modeling to predict where the demand will be high with the goal that drivers can take care of the demand and search pricing can be minimized great hey siri can you remind me to book a cab at pm today ok ill remind you thanks no problem comment below some interesting everyday examples around you where machines are learning and doing amazing jobs so thats all for machine learning basics today from my site keep watching this space for more interesting videos until then happy learning
E0Hmnixke2g,all machine learning algorithms explained in min,in the next minutes i will give you an overview of the most important machine learning algorithms to help you decide which one is right for your problem my name is tim and i have been a data scientist for over years and taught all of these algorithms to hundreds of students in real life machine learning boot camps there is a simple strategy for picking the right algorithm for your problem in minutes you will know how to pick the right one for any problem and get a basic intuition of each algorithm and how they relate to each other my goal is to give as many of you as possible an intuitive understanding of the major machine learning algorithms to make you stop feeling overwhelmed according to wikipedia machine learning is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions much of the recent advancements in ai are driven by neural networks which i hope to give you an intuitive understanding of by the end of this video lets divide machine learning into its subfields generally machine learning is divided into two areas supervised learning and unsupervised learning supervised learning is when we have a data set with any number of independent variables also called features or input variables and a dependent variable also called target or output variable that is supposed to be predicted we have a socalled training data set where we know the true values for the output variable also called labels that we can train our algorithm on to later predict the output variable for new unknown data examples could be predicting the price of a house the output variable based on features of the house say square footage location year of construction etc categorizing an object as a cat or a dog the output variable or label based on features of the object say height weight size of the ears color of the eyes etc unsupervised learning is basically any learning problem that is not supervised so where no truth about the data is known so where a supervised algorithm would be like showing a little kid what a typical cat looks like and what a typical dog looks like and then giving it a new picture and asking it what animal it sees an unsupervised algorithm would be giving a kid with no idea of what cats and dogs are a pile of pictures of animals and asking it to group by similarity without any further instructions examples of unsupervised problems might be to sort all of your emails into three unspecified categories which you can then later inspect and name as you wish the algorithm will decide on its own how it will create those categories also called clusters lets start with supervised learning arguably the bigger and more important branch of machine learning there are broadly two subcategories in regression we want to predict a continuous numeric target variable for a given input variable using the example from before it could be predicting the price of a house given any number features of a house and determining their relationship to the final price of the house we might for example find out that square footage is directly proportional to the price linear dependence but that the age of the house has no influence on the price of the house in classification we try to assign a discrete categorical label also called a class to a data point for example we may want to assign the label spam or no spam to an email based on its content sender and so on but we could also have more than two classes for example junk primary social promotions and updates as gmail does by default now lets dive into the actual algorithms starting with the mother of all machine learning algorithms linear regression in general supervised learning algorithms try to determine the relationship between two variables we try to find the function that maps one to the other linear regression in its simplest form is trying to determine a linear relationship between two variables namely the input and the output we want to fit a linear equation to the data by minimizing the sum of squares of the distances between data points and the regression line this simply minimizes the average distance of the real data to our predictive model in this case the regression line and should therefore minimize prediction errors for new data points a simple example of a linear relationship might be the height and shoe size of a person where the regression fit might tell us that for every one unit of shoe size increase the person will be on average ines taller you can make your model more complex and fit multidimensional data to an output variable in the example of the shoe size you might for example want to include the gender age and ethnicity of the person to get an even better model many of the very fancy machine learning algorithms including neural networks are just extensions of this very simple idea as i will show you later in the video logistic regression is a variant of linear regression and probably the most basic classification algorithm instead of fitting a line to two numerical variables with a presumably linear relationship you now try to predict a categorical output variable using categorical or numerical input variables lets look at an example we now want to predict one of two classes for example the gender of a person based on height and weight so a linear regression wouldnt make much sense anymore instead of fitting a line to the data we now fit a socalled sigmoid function to the data which looks like this the equation will now not tell us about a linear relationship between two variables but will now conveniently tell us the probability of a data point falling into a certain class given the value of the input variable so for example the likelihood of an adult person with a height of cm being a man would be this is completely made up of course the k nearest neighbors algorithm or knn is a very simple and intuitive algorithm that can be used for both regression and class ification it is a socalled nonparametric algorithm the name means that we dont try to fit any equations and thus find any parameters of a model so no true model fitting is necessary the idea of knn is simply that for any given new data point we will predict the target to be the average of its k nearest neighbors while this might seem very simple this is actually a very powerful predictive algorithm especially when relationships are more complicated than a simple linear relationship in a classification example we might say that the gender of a person will be the same as the majority of the five people closest in weight and height to the person in question in a regression example we might say that the weight of a person is the average weight of the three people closest in height and of chest circumference this makes a ton of intuitive sense you might realize that the number three seems a bit arbitrary and it is k is called a hyperparameter of the algorithm and choosing the right k is an art choosing a very small number of k say one or two will lead to your model predicting your training data set very well but not generalizing well to unseen data this is called overfitting choosing a very large number say will lead to a worst fit over overall this is called underfitting the best number is somewhere in between and depends a lot on the problem at hand methods for finding the right hyperparameters include cross validation but are beyond the scope of this video support vector machine is a supervised machine learning algorithm originally designed for classification tasks but it can also be used for regression tasks the core concept of the algorithm is to draw a decision boundary between data points that separates data points of the training set as well as possible as the name suggests a new unseen data point will be classified according to where it falls with respect to the decision boundary lets take this arbitrary example of trying to classify animals by their weight and the length of their nose in this simple case of trying to classify cats and elephants the decision boundary is a straight line the svm algorithm tries to find the line that separates the classes with the largest margin possible that is maximizing the space between the different classes this makes the decision boundary generalize well and less sensitive to noise and outliers in the training data the socalled support vectors are the data points that sit on the edge of the margin knowing the support vectors is enough to classify new data points which often makes the algorithm very memory efficient one of the benefits of spm is that it is very powerful in high dimensions that is if the number of features is large compared to the size of the data in those higher dimensional cases the decision boundary is called a hyperplane another feature that makes svms extremely powerful is the use of socalled kernel functions which allow for the identification of highly complex nonlinear decision boundaries kernel functions are an implicit way to turn your original features into new more complex features using the socalled kernel trick which is beyond the scope of this video this allows for efficient creation of nonlinear decision boundaries by creating complex new features such as weight divided by height squared also called the bmi this is called implicit feature engineering neural networks take the idea of implicit feature engineering to the next level as i will explain later possible kernel functions for svms are the linear the polinomial the rbf and the sigmoid kernel another fairly simple classifier is the naive bas classifier that gets its name from b theorem which looks like this i believe its easiest to understand naive bay with an example use case that it is often used for spam filters we can train our algorithm with a number of spam and nonspam emails and count the occurrences of different words in each class and thereby calculate the probability of certain words appearing in spam emails and nonspam emails we can then quickly classify a new email based on the words it contains by by using base theorem we simply multiply the different probabilities of all words in the email together this algorithm makes the false assumption that the probabilities of the different words appearing are independent of each other which is why we call this classifier naive this makes it very computation ally efficient while still being a good approximation for many use cases such as spam classification and other textbased classification tasks decision trees are the basis of a number of more complex supervised learning algorithms in its simplest form a decision tree looks somewhat like this the decision tree is basically a series of yes no questions that allow us to partition a data set in several dimensions here is an example decision tree for classifying people into high and lowrisk patients for heart attacks the goal of the decision tree algorithm is to create socalled leaf nodes at the bottom of the tree that are as pure as possible meaning instead of randomly splitting the data we try to find splits that lead to the resulting groups or leaves to be as pure as possible which is to say that as few data points as possible are misclassified while this might seem like a very basic and simple algorithm which it is we can turn it into a very powerful algorithm by combining many decision trees together combining many simple models to a more powerful complex model is called an ensemble algorithm one form of ensembling is bagging where we train multiple models on different subsets of the training data using a method called bootstrap a famous version of this idea is called a random forest where many decision trees vote on the classification of your data by majority vote of the different trees in the random forest random forests are very powerful estimators that can be used both for classification and regression the randomness comes from randomly excluding features for different trees in the forest which prevents overfitting and makes it much more robust because it removes correlation between the trees another type of ensemble method is called boosting where instead of running many decision trees in parallel like for random forests we train models in sequence where each model focuses on fixing the errors made by the previous model we combine a series of weak models in sequence thus becoming a strong model because each sequential model tries to fix the errors of the previous model boosted trees often get to higher accuracies than random forests but are also more prone to overfitting its sequential nature makes it slower to train than random forests famous examples of boosted trees are ada boost gradient boosting and xg boost the details of which are beyond the scope of this video now lets get to the reigning king of ai neural networks to to understand neural networks lets look at logistic regression again say we have a number of features and are trying to predict a target class the features might be pixel intensities of a digital image and the target might be classifying the image as one of the digits from to now for this particular case you might see why this might be difficult to do with logistic regression because say the number one doesnt look the same when different people write it and even if the same person writes it several times it will look slightly different each time and it wont be the exact same pixels illuminated for every instance of the number one all of the instances of the number one have commonality however like they all have a dominating vertical line and usually no crossing lines as other digits might have and usually there are no circular shapes in the number one as there would be in the number eight or or nine however the computer doesnt initially know about these more complex features but only the pixel intensities we could manually engineer these features by measuring some of these things and explicitly adding them as new features but artificial neural networks similarly to using a kernel function with a support vector machine are designed to implicitly and automatically design these features for us without any guidance from humans we do this by adding additional layers of unknown variables between the input and output variables in its simplest form this is called a single layer percep chop which is basically just a multifeature regression task now if we add a hidden layer the hidden variables in the middle layer represent some hidden unknown features and instead of predicting the target variable directly we try to predict these hidden features with our input features and then try to predict the target variables with our new hidden features in our specific example we might be able to say that every time several pixels are illuminated next to each other they represent a horizontal line which can be a new feature to try and predict the digit in question even though we never explicitly defined a feature called horizontal line this is a much simplified view of what is actually going on but hopefully this gets the point across we dont usually know what the hidden features represent we just train the neural network to predict the final target as well as possible the hidden features we can design this way are limited in the case of the single hidden layer but what if we add a layer and have the hidden layer predict another hidden layer what if we now had even more layers this is called deep learning and can result in very complex hidden features so that might represent all kinds of complex information in the pictures like the fact that there is a face in the picture however we will usually not know what the hidden features mean we just know that they result in good predictions all we have talked about so far is supervised learning where we wanted to predict a specific target variable using some input variables however sometimes we dont have anything specific to predict and just want to find some underlying structure in our data thats where unsupervised learning comes in a very common unsupervised problem is clustering its easy to confuse clustering with classification but they are conceptually very different classification is when we know the classes we want to predict and have training data with true labels available shown as colors here like pictures of cats and dogs clustering is when we dont have any labels and want to find unknown clusters just by looking at the overall structure of the data and trying to find potential clusters in the data for example we might look at a twodimensional data set that looks like this any human will probably easily see three clusters here but its not always as straightforward as your data might might also look like this we dont know how many clusters there are because the problem is unsupervised the most famous clustering algorithm is called k means clustering just like for knn k is a hyperparameter and stands for the number of clusters you are looking for finding the right number of clusters again is an art and has a lot to do with your specific problem and some trial and error in domain knowledge might be required this is beyond the scope of this video k means is very simple you start by randomly selecting centers for your k clusters and assigning all data points to the cluster center closest to them the clusters here are shown in blue and green you then recalculate the cluster centers based on the data points now assigned to them you can see the centers moving closer to the actual clusters you then assign the data points again to the new cluster centers followed by recalculating the cluster centers you repeat this process until the centers of the clusters have stabilized while k means is the most famous and most common clustering algorithm other algorithms exist including some where you dont need to specify the number of clusters like hierarchical clustering and db scan which can find clusters of arbitrary shape but i wont discuss them here the last type of algorithm i will leave you with is dimensionality reduction the idea of dimensionality reduction is to reduce the number of features or dimensions of your data set keeping as much information as possible usually this group of algorithms does this by finding correlations between existing features and removing potentially redundant dimensions without losing much information for example do you really need a picture in high resolution to recognize the airplane in the picture or can you reduce the number of pixels in the image as such dimensionality reduction will give you information about the relationships within your existing features and it can also be used as a preprocessing step in your supervised learning algorithm to reduce the number of features in your data set and make the algorithm more efficient and robust an example algorithm is principal component analysis or pca lets say we are trying to predict types of fish based on several features like length height color and number of teeth when looking at the correlations of the different features we might find that height and length are strongly correlated and including both both wont help the algorithm much and might in fact hurt it by introducing noise we can simply include a shape feature that is a combination of the two this is actually extremely common in large data sets and allows us to reduce the number of features dramatically and still get good results pca does this by finding the directions in which most variance in the data set is retained in this example the direction of most variant is a diagonal this is called the first principal component or pc and can become our new shape feature the second principal component is orthogonal to the first and only explains a small fr c of the variant of the data set and can thus be excluded from our data set in this case in large data sets we can do this for all features and rank them by explain variants and exclude any principal components that dont contribute much to the variant and thus wouldnt help much in our ml model this was all common machine learning algorithms explained if you are overwhelmed and dont know which algorithm you need here is a great cheat sheet by syit learn that will help you decide which algorithm is right for which type of problem if you want a road map on how to learn machine learning check out my video on that
i_LwzRVP7bg,machine learning for everybody full course,kylie ying has worked at many interesting places such as mit cern and free code camp shes a physicist engineer and basically a genius and now shes going to teach you about machine learning in a way that is accessible to absolute beginners whats up you guys so welcome to machine learning for everyone if you are someone who is interested in machine learning and you think you are considered as everyone then this video is for you in this video well talk about supervised and unsupervised learning models well go through maybe a little bit of the logic or math behind them and then well also see how we can program it on google colab if there are certain things that i have done and you know youre somebody with more experience than me please feel free to correct me in the comments and we can all as a community learn from this together so with that lets just dive right in without wasting any time lets just dive straight into the code and i will be teaching you guys concepts as we go so this here is the uci machine learning repository and basically they just have a ton of data sets that we can access and i found this really cool one called the magic gamma telescope data set so in this data set if you want to read all this information to summarize what i what i think is going on is theres this gamma telescope and we have all these high energy particles hitting the telescope now theres a camera theres a detector that actually records certain patterns of you know how this light hits the camera and we can use properties of those patterns in order to predict what type of particle caused that radiation so whether it was a gamma particle or some other head like hadron down here these are all of the attributes of those patterns that we collect in the camera so you can see that theres you know some length width size asymmetry etc now were going to use all these properties to help us discriminate the patterns and whether or not they came from a gamma particle or hadron so in order to do this were going to come up here go to the data folder and youre going to click this magic zero for data and were going to download that now over here i have a colab notebook open so you go to colab dot research dot googlecom you start a new notebook and im just going to call this the magic data set so actually im going to call this for code camp magic example okay so with that im going to first start with some imports so i will import you know i always import numpy i always import pandas and i always import matplotlib and then well import other things as we go so yeah we run that in order to run the cell you can either click this play button here or you can on my computer its just shift enter and that that will run the cell and here im just going to order im just going to you know let you guys know okay this is where i found the data set so ive copied and pasted this actually but this is just where i found the data set and in order to import that downloaded file that we we got from the computer were going to go over here to this folder thing and i am literally just going to drag and drop that file into here okay so in order to take a look at you know what does this file consist of do we have the labels do we not i mean we could open it on our computer but we can also just do pandas read csv and we can pass in the name of this file and lets see what it returns so it doesnt seem like we have the label so lets go back to here im just going to make the columns the column labels all of these attribute names over here so im just going to take these values and make that the column names all right how do i do that so basically i will come back here and i will create a list called calls and i will type in all of those things with f size f conk and we also have f conk one we have f symmetry f m three long f m three trans f alpha lets see we have f dist and class okay great now in order to label those as these columns down here in our data frame so basically this command here just reads some csv file that you pass in csv has come about comma separated values and turns that into a pandas data frame object so now if i pass in a names here then it basically assigns these labels to the columns of this data set so im going to set this data frame equal to df and then if we call the head is just like give me the first five things give me the first five things now youll see that we have labels for all of these okay all right great so one thing that you might notice is that over here the class labels we have g and h so if i actually go down here and i do data frame class unique youll see that i have either gs or hs and these stand for gammas or hadrons and our computer is not so good at understanding letters right our computer is really good at understanding numbers so what were going to do is were going to convert this to zero for g and one for h so here im going to set this equal to this whether or not that equals g and then im just going to say as type int so what this should do is convert this entire column if it equals g then this is true so i guess that would be one and then if its h it would be false so that would be zero but im just converting g and h to one and zero it doesnt really matter like if g is one and h is zero or vice versa let me just take a step back right now and talk about this data set so here i have some data frame and i have all of these different values for each entry now this is a you know each of these is one sample its one example its one item in our data set its one data point all of these things are kind of the same thing when i mentioned oh this is one example or this is one sample or whatever now each of these samples they have you know one quality for each or one value for each of these labels up here and then it has the class now what were going to do in this specific example is try to predict for future you know samples whether the class is g for gamma or h for hadron and that is something known as classification now all of these up here these are known as our features and features are just things that were going to pass into our model in order to help us predict the label which in this case is the class column so for you know sample zero i have different features so i have different values that i can pass into some model and i can spit out you know the class the label and i know the true label here is g so this is this is actually supervised learning all right so before i move on let me just give you a quick little crash course on what i just said this is machine learning for everyone well the first question is what is machine learning well machine learning is a sub domain of computer science that focuses on certain algorithms which might help a computer learn from data without a programmer being there telling the computer exactly what to do thats what we call explicit programming so you might have heard of ai and ml and data science what is the difference between all of these so ai is artificial intelligence and thats an area of computer science where the goal is to enable computers and machines to perform human like tasks and simulate human behavior now machine learning is a subset of ai that tries to solve one specific problem and make predictions using certain data and data science is a field that attempts to find patterns and draw insights from data and that might mean were using machine learning so all of these fields kind of overlap and all of them might use machine learning so there are a few types of machine learning the first one is supervised learning and in supervised learning were using labeled inputs so this means whatever input we get we have a corresponding output label in order to train models and to learn outputs of different new inputs that we might feed our model so for example i might have these pictures okay to a computer all these pictures are are pixels theyre pixels with a certain color now in supervised learning all of these inputs have a label associated with them this is the output that we might want the computer to be able to predict so for example over here this picture is a cat this picture is a dog and this picture is a lizard now theres also unsupervised learning and in unsupervised learning we use unlabeled data to learn about patterns in the data so here are here are my input data points again theyre just images theyre just pixels well okay lets say i have a bunch of these different pictures and what i can do is i can feed all these to my computer and i might not you know my computer is not going to be able to say oh this is a cat dog and lizard in terms of you know the output but it might be able to cluster all these pictures it might say hey all of these have something in common all of these have something in common and then these down here have something in common thats finding some sort of structure in our unlabeled data and finally we have reinforcement learning and reinforcement learning well they usually theres an agent that is learning in some sort of interactive environment based on rewards and penalties so lets think of a dog we can train our dog but theres not necessarily you know any wrong or right output at any given moment right well lets pretend that dog is a computer essentially what were doing is were giving rewards to our computer and tell your computer hey this is probably something good that you want to keep doing well computer agent terminology but in this class today well be focusing on supervised learning and unsupervised learning and learning different models for each of those alright so lets talk about supervised learning first so this is kind of what a machine learning model looks like you have a bunch of inputs that are going into some model and then the model is spitting out an output which is our prediction so all these inputs this is what we call the feature vector now there are different types of features that we can have we might have qualitative features and qualitative means categorical data theres either a finite number of categories or groups so one example of a qualitative feature might be gender and in this case theres only two here its for the sake of the example i know this might be a little bit outdated here we have a girl and a boy there are two genders there are two different categories thats a piece of qualitative data another example might be okay we have you know a bunch of different nationalities maybe a nationality or a nation or a location that might also be an example of categorical data now in both of these theres no inherent order its not like you know we can rate us one and france to japan three etc right theres not really any inherent order built into either of these categorical data sets thats why we call this nominal data now for nominal data the way that we want to feed it into our computer is using something called one hot encoding so lets say that you know i have a data set some of the items in our data some of the inputs might be from the us some might be from india then canada then france now how do we get our computer to recognize that we have to do something called one hot encoding and basically one hot encoding is saying okay well if it matches some category make that a one and if it doesnt just make that a zero so for example if your input were from the us you would you might have india you know canada okay well the item representing canada is one and then france the item representing france is one and then you can see that the rest are zeros thats one hot encoding now there are also a different type of qualitative feature so here on the left there are different age groups theres babies toddlers teenagers young adults adults and so on right and on the right hand side we might have different ratings so maybe bad not so good mediocre good and then like great now these are known as ordinal pieces of data because they have some sort of inherent order right like being a toddler is a lot closer to being a baby than being an elderly person right or good is closer to great than it is to really bad so these have some sort of inherent ordering system and so for these types of data sets we can actually just mark them from you know one to five or we can just say hey for each of these lets give it a number and this makes sense because like for example the thing that i just said how good is closer to great then good is close to not good at all well four is closer to five then four is close to one so this actually kind of makes sense and itll make sense for the computer as well alright there are also quantitative pieces of data and quantitative pieces of data are numerical valued pieces of data so this could be discrete which means you know they might be integers or it could be continuous which means all real numbers so for example the length of something is a quantitative piece of data its a quantitative feature the temperature of something is a quantitative feature and then maybe how many easter eggs i collected in my basket this easter egg hunt that is an example of discrete quantitative feature okay so these are continuous and this over here is the screen so those are the things that go into our feature vector those are our features that were feeding this model because our computers are really really good at understanding math right at understanding numbers theyre not so good at understanding things that humans might be able to understand well what are the types of predictions that our model can output so in supervised learning there are some different tasks theres one classification and basically classification just saying okay predict discrete classes and that might mean you know this is a hot dog this is a pizza and this is ice cream okay so there are three distinct classes and any other pictures of hot dogs pizza or ice cream i can put under these labels hot dog pizza ice cream hot dog pizza ice cream this is something known as multi class classification but theres also binary classification and binary classification you might have hot dog or not hot dog so theres only two categories that youre working with something that is something and something thats isnt binary classification okay so yeah other examples so if something has positive or negative sentiment thats binary classification maybe youre predicting your pictures of their cats or dogs thats binary classification maybe you know you are writing an email filter and youre trying to figure out if an email spam or not spam so thats also binary classification now for multi class classification you might have you know cat dog lizard dolphin shark rabbit etc we might have different types of fruits like orange apple pear etc and then maybe different plant species but multi class classification just means more than two okay and binary means were predicting between two things theres also something called regression when we talk about supervised learning and this just means were trying to predict continuous values so instead of just trying to predict different categories were trying to come up with a number that you know is on some sort of scale so some examples so some examples might be the price of aetherium tomorrow or it might be okay what is going to be the temperature or it might be what is the price of this house right so these things dont really fit into discrete classes were trying to predict a number thats as close to the true value as possible using different features of our data set so thats exactly what our model looks like in supervised learning now lets talk about the model itself how do we make this model learn or how can we tell whether or not its even learning so before we talk about the models lets talk about how can we actually like evaluate these models or how can we tell whether something is a good model or bad model so lets take a look at this data set so this data set has this is from a diabetes a pima indian diabetes data set and here we have different number of pregnancies different glucose levels blood pressure skin thickness insulin bmi age and then the outcome whether or not they have diabetes one for they do zero for they dont so here all of these are quantitative features right because theyre all on some scale so each row is a different sample in the data so its a different example its one persons data and each row represents one person in this data set now this column each column represents a different feature so this one here is some measure of blood pressure levels and this one over here as we mentioned is the output label so this one is whether or not they have diabetes and as i mentioned this is what we would call a feature vector because these are all of our features in one sample and this is whats known as the target or the output for that feature vector thats what were trying to predict and all of these together is our features matrix x and over here this is our labels or targets vector y so ive condensed this to a chocolate bar to kind of talk about some of the other concepts in machine learning so over here we have our x our features matrix and over here this is our label y so each row of this will be fed into our model right and our model will make some sort of prediction and what we do is we compare that prediction to the actual value of y that we have in our label data set because thats the whole point of supervised learning is we can compare what our model is outputting to oh what is the truth actually and then we can go back and we can adjust some things so the next iteration we get closer to what the true value is so that whole process here the tinkering that okay whats the difference where did we go wrong thats whats known as training the model alright so take this whole you know chunk right here do we want to really put our entire chocolate bar into the model to train our model not really right because if we did that then how do we know that our model can do well on new data that we havent seen like if i were to create a model to predict whether or not someone has diabetes lets say that i just train all my data and i see that all my training data does well i go to some hospital im like heres my model i think you can use this to predict if somebody has diabetes do we think that would be effective or not probably not right because we havent assessed how well our model can generalize okay it might do well after you know our model has seen this data over and over and over again but what about new data can our model handle new data well how do we how do we get our model to assess that so we actually break up our whole data set that we have into three different types of data sets we call it the training data set the validation data set and the testing data set and you know you might have here and or and it really depends on how many statistics you have i think either of those would be acceptable so what we do is then we feed the training data set into our model we come up with you know this might be a vector of predictions corresponding with each sample that we put into our model we figure out okay whats the difference between our prediction and the true values this is something known as loss losses you know whats the difference here in some numerical quantity of course and then we make adjustments and thats what we call training okay so then once you know weve made a bunch of adjustments we can put our validation set through this model and the validation set is kind of used as a reality check during or after training to ensure that the model can handle unseen data still so every single time after we train one iteration we might stick the validation set in and see hey whats the loss there and then after our training is over we can assess the validation set and ask hey whats the loss there but one key difference here is that we dont have that training step this loss never gets fed back into the model right that feedback loop is not closed alright so lets talk about loss really quickly so here i have four different types of models i have some sort of data thats being fed into the model and then some output okay so this output here is pretty far from you know this truth that we want and so this loss is going to be high in model b again this is pretty far from what we want so this loss is also going to be high lets give it now this one here its pretty close i mean maybe not almost but pretty close to this one so that might have a loss of and then this one here is maybe further than this but still better than these two so that loss might be okay so which of these model performs the best well model c has a smallest loss so its probably model c okay now lets take model c after you know weve come up with these all these models and weve seen okay model c is probably the best model we take model c and we run our test set through this model and this test set is used as a final check to see how generalizable that chosen model is so if i you know finish training my diabetes data set then i could run it through some chunk of the data and i can say oh like this is how we perform on data that its never seen before at any point during the training process okay and that loss thats the final reported performance of my test set or this would be the final reported performance of my model okay so lets talk about this thing called loss because i think i kind of just glossed over it right so loss is the difference between your prediction and the actual like label so this would give a slightly higher loss than this and this would even give a higher loss because its even more off in computer science we like formulas right we like formulaic ways of describing things so here are some examples of loss functions and how we can actually come up with numbers this here is known as l one loss and basically l one loss just takes the absolute value of whatever your you know real value is whatever the real output label is subtracts the predicted value and takes the absolute value of that okay so the absolute value is a function that looks something like this so the further off you are the greater your losses right in either direction so if your real value is off from your predicted value by then your loss for that point would be and then this sum here just means hey were taking all the points in our data set and were trying to figure out the sum of how far everything is now we also have something called l two loss so this loss function is quadratic which means that if its close the penalty is very minimal and if its off by a lot then the penalty is much much higher okay and this instead of the absolute value we just square the the difference between the two now theres also something called binary cross entropy loss it looks something like this and this is for binary classification this this might be the loss that we use so this loss you know im not going to really go through it too much but you just need to know that loss decreases as the performance gets better so there are some other measures of accurate or performance as well so for example accuracy what is accuracy so lets say that these are pictures that im feeding my model okay and these predictions might be apple orange orange apple okay but the actual is apple orange apple apple so three of them were correct and one of them was incorrect so the accuracy of this model is three quarters or alright coming back to our colab notebook im going to close this a little bit again weve imported stuff up here and weve already created our data frame right here and this is this is all of our data this is what were going to use to train our models so down here again if we now take a look at our data set youll see that our classes are now zeros and ones so now this is all numerical which is good because our computer can now understand that okay and you know it would probably be a good idea to maybe kind of plot hey do these things have anything to do with the class so here im going to go through all the labels so for label in the columns of this data frame so this just gets me the list actually we have the list right its called so lets just use that might be less confusing of everything up to the last thing which is the class so im going to take all these different features and im going to plot them as a histogram so and now im going to plot them as a histogram so basically if i take that data frame and i say okay for everything where the class is equal to one so these are all of our gammas remember now for that portion of the data frame if i look at this label so now these okay what this part here is saying is inside the data frame get me everything where the class is equal to one so thats all all of these would fit into that category right and now lets just look at the label column so the first label would be f length which would be this column so this command here is getting me all the different values that belong to class one for this specific label and thats exactly what im going to put into the histogram and now im just going to tell you know matplotlib make the color blue make this label this as you know gamma set alpha why do i keep doing that alpha equal to so thats just like the transparency and then im going to set density equal to true so that when we compare it to the hadrons here well have a baseline for comparing them okay so the density being true just basically normalizes these distributions so you know if you have in of one type and then of another type well if you drew the histograms it would be hard to compare because one of them would be a lot bigger than the other right but by normalizing them we kind of are distributing them over how many samples there are alright and then im just going to put a title on here and make that the label the y label so because its density the y label is probability and the x label is just going to be the label what is going on and im going to include a legend and plt dot show just means okay display the plot so if i run that just be up to the last item so we want a list right not just the last item and now we can see that were plotting all of these so here we have the length oh and i made this gamma so this should be hadron okay so the gammas in blue the hadrons are in red so here we can already see that you know maybe if the length is smaller its probably more likely to be gamma right and we can kind of you know these all look somewhat similar but here okay clearly if theres more asymmetry or if you know this asymmetry measure is larger then its probably hadron okay oh this ones a good one so f alpha seems like hadrons are pretty evenly distributed whereas if this is smaller it looks like theres more gammas in that area okay so this is kind of what the data that were working with we can kind of see whats going on okay so the next thing that were going to do here is we are going to create our train our validation and our test data sets im going to set train valid and test to be equal to this so numpy dot split im just splitting up the data frame and if i do this sample where im sampling everything this will basically shuffle my data now if i i want to pass in where exactly im splitting my data set so the first split is going to be maybe at so im going to say times the length of this data frame so and then cast that integer thats going to be the first place where you know i cut it off and thatll be my training data now if i then go to this basically means everything between and of the length of the data set will go towards validation and then like everything from to im going to pass my test data so i can run that and now if we go up here and we inspect this data well see that these columns seem to have values in like the s whereas this one is right so the scale of all these numbers is way off and sometimes that will affect our results so im going to run this is way off and sometimes that will affect our results so one thing that we would want to do is scale these so that they are you know so that its now relative to maybe the mean and the standard deviation of that specific column im going to create a function called scale data set and im going to pass in the data frame and thats what ill do for now okay so the x values are going to be you know i take the data frame and lets assume that the columns are going to be you know that the label will always be the last thing in the data frame so what i can do is say data frame dot columns all the way up to the last item and get those values now for my y well its the last column so i can just do this i can just index into that last column and then get those values now in so im actually going to import something known as the standard scalar from sk learn so if i come up here i can go to sk learn dot pre processing and im going to import standard scalar i have to run that cell im going to come back down here and now im going to create a scalar and use that skip or so standard scalar and with the scalar what i can do is actually just fit and transform x so here i can say x is equal to scalar dot fit fit transform x so what thats doing is saying okay take x and fit the standard scalar to x and then transform all those values and what would it be and thats going to be our new x alright and then im also going to just create you know the whole data as one huge d numpy array and in order to do that im going to call h stack so h stack is saying okay take an array and another array and horizontally stack them together thats what the h stands for so by horizontally stacked them together just like put them side by side okay not on top of each other so what am i stacking well i have to pass in something so that it can stack x and y and now okay so numpy is very particular about dimensions right so in this specific case our x is a two dimensional object but y is only a one dimensional thing its only a vector of values so in order to now reshape it into a d item we have to call numpy dot reshape and we can pass in the dimensions of its reshape so if i pass in negative one comma one that just means okay make this a d array where the negative one just means infer what what this dimension value would be which ends up being the length of y this would be the same as literally doing this but the negative one is easier because were making the computer do the hard work so if i stack that im going to then return the data x and y okay so one more thing is that if we go into our training data set okay again this is our training data set and we get the length of the training data set but where the training data sets class is one so remember that this is the gammas and then if we print that and we do the same thing but zero well see that you know theres around of the gammas but only around of the hadrons so that might actually become an issue and instead what we want to do is we want to oversample our our training data set so that means that we want to increase the number of these values so that these kind of match better and surprise surprise there is something that we can import that will help us do that its so im going to go to from in the learn dot oversampling and im going to import this random oversampler run that cell and come back down here so i will actually add in this parameter called oversample and set that to false for default and if i do want
p-jKhQQ8ztM,brain health the impact of what you eat vantage with palki sharma,before we begin our last story tonight lets go back to medieval times during the middle ages people held a strong idea about food they believed that what they ate affected their mood so if they were feeling down they would reach for dates or pairs if they were anxious it would be chory or lettuce but over the years it seems to have changed we seem to have lost the idea that food can affect our brain today as a society we are so used to feeding our bodies that we seldom think of the brain we connect what we eat with the shape of our waistline and many of us forget that the same diet feeds one of our biggest organs the brain food alters our brain chemistry it shapes our thoughts and our actions you may have heard the saying you are what you eat well its true decades of research proves it your stomach and brain have a connection and it begins before youre even born it starts in the womb the brain and the gut originate from the same cells in the embryo and as you grow older this connection only gets stronger so much so that the gut is called the second brain day after day what you eat is broken down it turns into nutrients these nutrients take are taken into the bloodstream theyre carried up to the brain and once there they become the very fabric of your brain and this is very crucial you see our brain works very hard it works hours a day even when we sleep the brain is active so it needs a lot of fuel our brain makes up only of our body weight but it uses of our energy the brain is the hungriest organ so what we feed it matters i can give you three reasons why first because of the minds physical building blocks our cells replace continuously you probably learned this in primary school but a quick disclaimer while this is true for most of the body it does not apply to the brain a majority of our of of our brain cells stay with us for our entire lives so if you need high quality brain cells you need high quality food now healthy food protects your body you know that it can protect you from cancer diabetes heart disease it can make you live longer but it also helps your brain and this is the second reason a healthy diet can protect your mind it can shield your brain from harm it reduces the risk of stroke it slows brain aging it boosts memory it even reduces the risk of alzheimers this is the same disease that affects million people today by it is projected to affect million people and for the longest time this projection has seemed inevitable because alzheimers is seen as a result of bad genes and aging but heres what newer research says the genes may load the gun but it is the lifestyle that pulls the trigger onethird of all alzheimers cases can be prevented if people eat a healthy diet so there are longterm benefits and shortterm ones shortterm ones as well this brings us to the third reason food can affect your mood it can happen when you dont eat something for instance if you have a vitamin b deficiency you are more prone to depression it can also happen when you eat too much of something if you eat a lot of processed foods a lot of sugar it increase increases inflammation this is the root cause of stress and low mood yet the world over six out of every people eat junk food regularly while nine out of do not eat enough fruits and vegetables the good thing is its never too late to start our brain has a fascinating quality it is plastic so the way you learn a new language or a new skill you can train your brain to prefer healthy food to eat better and the way new information changes your thoughts opinions and actions healthy food can make you a better version of yourself so listen to your gut and start feeding your brain right from breaking news to the days biggest controversies shedding light on the worlds top headlines detailed analysis on the stories that matter the most to you catch it all all on spotlight at pm india time and gmt only on first post

0-M3Z0e3Oak,new health home life update lydia elise millen,music music i have found the perfect spot for my car look you can see my breath the temperature has dropped only in the last couple of days in fact id say since new year its all of a sudden got so much colder and im so happy about it because i know that when its cold like this we are literally weeks from starting to see the first signs of a finally the windscreen wipers are working frosted shut um im just moving the defender because were going out in our range rover but hi oh my god hi wow what an end to in that it was a catastrophic flop not in the energy sense of the word what i mean is that i think pretty much everyone in england at least was ill and i got ill again again not as bad as last time but i think you can probably still hear it in my voice im not over it and its just one of those things that i think that everyone was just getting ill over the christmas period so whilst im a bit frustrated because there were so many things like on a downtime personal level that i wanted to get done i honestly i dont think ive slept so much i would wake up id go on to the sofa id read my book id fall asleep ally would like the fire for me and it was just as much as it was frustrating it was actually like bliss as well but im just waiting for ally to get ready and then were heading to spend some of our christmas vouchers cuz we realized weve got like bford vouchers dalesford vouchers waitrose vouchers so many vouchers to spend and we are terrible at spending vouchers like we we literally went to waitrose the other day with our voucher forgot to use it so um but welcome back to with lydia millan and in all honesty i have done so much thinking in my like calm restful break and a lot of the thinking that ive done is that im really really content and whilst last year i was noting down goals and i was putting targets and i was putting all of these things in place im still going to have those as a sort of thing like theyre just theyre going to be a thing that im aware that i want to do this and i want to do that but its not the focus for everything in all honesty i am just just happy and calm and peaceful and i really want that to continue into and so that is mostly what im thinking about um there are changes that im going to be making hopefully you will be watching this on a tuesday and tuesday will now be my new upload day from monday still doing thursdays but changing my monday upload to tuesday it just always felt like a bit of a scramble on a monday to get everything in line and get everything done and youll know that most of the time all i want to do is just do a good job and make sure that everything is done well for you guys and just having that time to curate all of the content make it more succinct and put together really nicely i think thats going to be a really welcomed change so tuesdays and thursdays moving forward and i hope that that will work better for you guys as well um i have a number of areas i want to focus this year as well in terms of my content youll know that over the last few years i have really like rained things in quite a lot and i want to continue to do that not in terms of work i love working i love my job i love every element of this but as i get older what i love most than more than anything most than anything terrible english is life and home and everything that comes with that and creating that and having that and enjoying that and i started to focus a lot on homem making and things like that last year and i really want to continue that into thats l to to say if any of my clients are watching thats not to say i dont want to go places okay i just want to make that very clear but i always say that from the getgo i just want there to be value in what im doing and so hopefully ill still be able to do lots of lovely travel things um but just a lot more focused and value orientated hopefully well well have a little bit of a chat about this throughout this video actually im not going to put it at the beginning but welcome back i hope you had the break that you needed i hope you had the most wonderful start of the year and new years and all of that kind of thing if you were ill too hi how are you yeah me too i didnt escape it either but we are heading to dalesford and berford today to spend some vouchers and just pick up a few little bits for midwinter midwinter is the hardest season i think when you live in england for a lot of people for me now that ive navigated it and found my like happy place with it i actually get quite excited about midwinter but i get excited because i do lots of these things and i um do lots of the things that you see me do throughout the year and so thats what were going to be focusing on today hopefully im going to be able to go to the shops find a few little bits to just refresh my home um tick things off my list and hunker down for the cold cold months if you struggle with midwinter as a month its very dark it can be very cold the weather can be very very wild i hope through my content ill be able to highlight even more of the wonderful things that you can hopefully do in midwinter and um find joy and happiness in that because i have learned to love this time of year in fact i almost feel excited for this cold cozy weather i can see the frost on the hyd ranger heads the like brown hranger heads and it fills me with so much joy and i want that for you guys too and i know that there will be so many people being like oh lydia our evergreen hearts know exactly what youre talking about but if not if youre new here if you if youre someone that maybe is just coming across me for the first time im lydia and ive been doing this for years and i have written a book on finding the joy in the seasons its kind of like a part memoir part life lesson part selfhelp part cookery we threw a bit of everything in there and in the hope that there would be elements of joy that you would find there so if youre looking to sort of um enjoy the seasons reconnect with nature find the joy in the seasons then ill link my book down below but generally my content centers around that anyway and i am going to share my loves and the things that i do and all of that kind of stuff throughout the the year with you in the hope that i can help you with finding more of that in your life too wherever you are in the world i mean i might not know whats growing at the time of year but youll know and youll be able to go out and say gosh you know im living in new zealand and oh look at this growing at this time of year how beautiful is that how wonderful is that and the sense of calm that washes over me whenever i do that no matter where i am in the world is really really special the sun is about to blind me so im going to go and chase my husband out of the house im moving this car cuz were going in the land rover were predicted snow at the moment another thing to look forward to so im going to move on over although im in my husbands position in this car which is very difficult for me to navigate oo taking off very quickly there um so were going to jump in our car on this beautiful bright winters day i have to say the these kinds of winters dayss are my favorite um theyre not always the most common but when they come around my goodness me do they set my tiny little heart on fire and today is one of those days the sun was streaming through the um oh the wildlife was just wonderful did you see that deer oh spectacular and so its lovely to be leaving the house also leaving the house a little bit better feeling like myself to go and spend a day hopefully doing some things that will help me refresh my home and make things feel a little bit more optimistic because this is a super optimistic time of year i have to say first bulbs are just starting to come up through the soil um in the woodland so around this time of year you start to see hbor you start to see snow drops and that is the first signs of life emerging after the winter and it is so incredibly exciting and we get to see all of that here in england it is really were so lucky that we get those four distinct seasons and for me refreshing my space is a huge huge part especially post christmas and new years you want to fling open your windows you want to clean your surface is you want to pack down your christmas decorations and really get on with the year and what the year is going to entail and i always find that doing things this way mean i start the year on the right foot anyway starting things on the right foot im going to go and shout at my husband and get him to get his ass in the car so that we can head to uh the shops oh thought i to show you a quick outfit of the day ive actually got my new mountain horse stable boots on but they look so lovely and they go so well with one of my christmas presents which is this really really really lovely vintage chocolate colored kelly pette she is now years old so she is officially vintage um and im wearing it with some beige deans a little nel cable net ive got a blazer underneath ive stolen my husbands scarf and an old husbands barber as well so that is my outfit for the day my husband is also would you like to come and show me how youre dressed stealing my style whoa whoa whoo just quickly just before we get into this okay mine mine yours mine also my husbands blazer so i dont think im steing her st true okay true um that is my prist yes me too why are they stop doing that they having this a different style oh thats what im saying to you this is the bo bow for thats i really like as oh yeah i really like that too anyway enough of your faffing we need to go this is a grand tour of my cars um im just waiting for ally still uh to get in the car but yes so i thought i would show you um what my main christmas present was under the tree um so shes years old it was sourced by uh luxury promise and it is the most beautiful chocolate poet i love this size so much because um its like bigger than a mini kelly and it fits so much more in it and i love it as well because it looks so cute under the arm and i feel like this is the best color for my like at home wardrobe like all of those muddier tones the chocolates the greens it just goes so nicely i love it so much i also got a little poette liner from baged ive got the little pouch in there at the moment um i got that for christmas too and i am so happy with her shes also a bit softer which i love so um this is the evergrain leather and i think that this is the leather that they no longer do they dont actually have the specific color of it either which i thought was super interesting um it looks to me like it could be ebet or chocolate i dont know um but it is glorious my husband has joined the chat as well sorry ally was getting in the car but no i am so so happy with it i just think it is so gorgeous and i love love love the color it just goes with everything like even a barber jacket i just love it so much we are now going to make the journey to i think were going to go to berford first and what i would really like to do is actually do the high street in berford as well cuz theres some really lovely shops i think most people are back to work today so for us it means its going to be a little bit quieter so well probably be able to like get around a little bit more so that is the plan of music action i always love the pottery section here but they also do a lot of really good recycled glass wear which is just really good to sort of pick bits up that you need for your kitchen oh wow we found the the dog section and it is everything i love about like this is amazing theyve got tweed collars what that oh yeah love this oh wow these ones over here so nice wow oh my word look at this weve got those for them already these are wax ones yeah but thats got wax on well no weve got them quilted ones but look at the tweed these are lovely so so lovely thats a really nice color as you can see there is lots of white blooms and ferns and even bulbs out it is so such an extravaganza of like early greenery which makes me very excited even ivy ivy is always so good to bring into your house at this time of year cuz its like a breath of fresh air it helps with with adding oxygen and things like that so its a really good one to music have i really like this tablescape i love the tones and its so simple with all of the little sprigs of wax flow and twig and ive got a tablecloth quite similar to this well i would say that that was a successful trip to berford although it was very very empty i think theyre prepping for the sort of spring stock to come in um but we ticked off a few things that we knew that we needed um like a new gravy jug very good find yeah actually and i like it because ally picked the pottery from the same collection that ive got other bits and pieces in the kitchen for already so im very happy about that wasnt the uh bordalo set but i think hes not still sold on those ally also picked himself up a do you want to pack of no thank you im fine is it wild for yeah sausage roll that was so lovely but ive never had it before he says hes never had it either so i will get a rating out of for the sausage roll from berford oh it smells lovely so mr milling gordon is going to give us a rating out of for his wild bo sausage roll from berford girth yeah thats a lot of meat dryness its pretty dry okay it was in a fridge yeah so its going to be cold yeah i think if it was heated up it would be out of you want some sauce with it as well dont you brought cold sausage roll than i expect yeah well no some sausage rolls are really good in like you know im not going to say the mw cuz carrie grayson is editing it but it is the um den yeah thats its its a lot of its a lot of meat smells delicious though smell it we finished up and we are now on route to the to berford high street which ive actually never been to before and ive always wanted to go but i think i always spend so much time in the garden center that i never have enough time to head to the town center um theres lots of really really lovely shops here and um lots of independence as well which is i think where i enjoy shopping the most so were going to have a mooch around i we did pick up some bits but more like a cals as well so i show you the bits that we picked up in berford when i get home essentials ess interesting well things like a gravy pot its not like you dont set out to always pick up a gravy pot on a teapot do you so its like kitchen essentials um but then we got some collars for the dogs we got really really lovely holland cooper black watch bow ties from jade holland cooper for christmas and they dont have navy collar um we have to be very sparingly with when we use collars on our dogs because barkley chews the nice ones off of porters neck which is not ideal but um we got them some new ones that hopefully can be worn for best and then a little rope toy as well but ill show you them when we get home music music were in the dalesford greenhouse and there are bulbs galore little bit left over from christmas cuz were still in that period but look at these nissi coming through theyre going to smell exquisite got lemon trees what i love this my love oh my gosh if we get a bit of wood we do and then i can hang on very similar to my yeah but we can do this in my greenhouse and then i can um put hooks for my gardening tools yeah oh yeah definitely having to do that beautiful views coming home little bit of water down there but that is a lovely lovely little sunset and it never comes across on camera wasnt it no not on that one it was on the phone yeah gorgeous oh my gosh we are back home and i think ive come up with a hairstyle that i can do really like loosely um that i feel nice in that also doesnt ruin like my hairstyle so you know ive got these little clips that i used to use for my half up half downs well i use three of them to put my hair up in a bun and it means no kinks and when i take my hair hair done ive still got like a lovely flicky blow dry it takes a while for the front bit to sort of loosen up a little bit but i tell you what thats not half bad and then if i want to i can also just do a little clipp aoo so i think three of these in my bag moving forward just these little tiny ones you can even like clip them onto the handles of your bag um let me just let porter out i dare go in anywhere where porter isnt allowed so i closed the door because um one of our housekeepers is here at the moment if i dare close the door hes like what is going on i need to inspect what youre doing first and foremost but anyway really really happy with that and i felt like my hair wasnt getting in my way all day now if you have noticed on my arm that i have rather an interesting graze there is a little tiny tiny bit of bruising um i dont i think the bruising has gone oh know theres a nice little healthy bit i think just about there of bruising i fell down the stairs um and it was actually quite it was it wasnt a bad fall down the stairs but it was just like it was so weird how it happened and we watched it back um on the cameras and it was very funny to watch back but it could have been a lot worse i just completely slipped and like all the way down so im like trying to stop myself with my arms um and ive noticed what day did it happen i think it was the day before new years so new years eve eve um ive just been popping some vitamin e oil on it and it looks like we are already well into the healing process theres like a little bit of it up here but yeah ive been in the wars over over the christmas period i cant believe it like how did i end up falling down the stairs but this is just pure vitamin e oil that i get on amazon um im trying to you use things on my body a little bit more naturally in i think i i love all of like you know the perfumes and this that and the other but im im trying to have them as bit as a bit more of like a special occasion thing rather than an everyday thing using like my natural deodorant on a on like an everyday basis and then when its like a special occasion if i need something a little bit stronger using that same with my body body creams i want to use like a nice body cream but on the dayto day i want to be using those like more natural things so ive actually whilst i was on the holidays made my first ever coconut and rosemary infused hair oil and ive been using it on my hair and i love it so much ive kind of made my own concoction of it and ill show you how ive done it but again just trying to use as many of the things that ive got in my garden to to make things lovely but look at the shine in my hair it just it feels so nice um so yeah vitamin e oil for the win at the moment because ive been in the wars but we are back uh from the shops and it was quite a we went to to berford high street and ive never been before ive never like done the walk down there and it was really lovely really lovely um not so many shops that i would like necessarily go back but it was good for like a one stop um and then we went went to bford garden company obviously as well picked up some really good like tick offthe list kitchen essentials then we went to dford and everything was kind of in the switch over from winter to like early spring and so we picked up more just like food bits and pieces oh my gosh and they had my chocolate my raw chocolate they havent had these for such a long time and they put them in new dispensers and the dispenser got stuck and i dont know whether theyre designed very well but they just poured out everywhere on the floor and i was like picking them up i was worried that someone was going to like i dont know it had like cartoon scenes of someone walking up and just going so i i did try and clear up after myself but i bought like about quids worth im going to put them all in my pantry because they are like my treat theyre raw chocolate and salted hazelnuts and they are so good i give myself like a handful of them a day and thats like my my enough for me to be like satisfied i dont really need anything else after that ally picked up some meat we got some crisps we got the crisps from berford cuz im really trying to find crisps that just dont have any upf in them same as last year really just made me focusing on lots of little bits and pieces like that but ill tell you about that tomorrow ive got the day and the whole day to myself at home ali is playing golf ive got a riding lesson in the evening oh feel like theres so much we need to catch up on but were going to make dinner this evening and um im going to curl up on the sofa with my book because i am on my third book of the year already i am so excited by my new christmas present you have no idea and ill tell you all about it so just to show you the uh collors that we got the boys theyre like a navy blue theyll probably look a little bit black in this light but these are the holland cooper bow ties that they got and they are so adorable and they look perfect actually are the perfect little collar for them so i think should we see if we can put them on you for a little while before barkley starts chewing it shall we okay mommy come on boys whos hoping that they fit right you first pine water there we go good boy off barkley park sniffing it like wy putting on my best friend oh so smart py so smart might need to tighten that up just a little bit so smart show daddy barkley your turn byy so smart do not oh water oh so smart so smart so smart bargy so smart now galina tells me that you were howling when we were gone little howling saucer music oh what is the meat that you picked up um that is something cross beef cross oo so youre searing it and then its going in the oven correct wow smells incredible no wonder you boys are hanging out down here even i would hang out down there if i was your time the bow ties should be on the back or the front front like your bow tie do you wear because theyre so like small no one sees them theyre just the worms no you do see them theyre just always facing down no if theyre on the back they look like a girl thats like the back of a dress oh py so these are the the raw chocolate and uh salted almonds and i think i need a bigger jar and these are some of the other snacks that i got at dalesford i think thats one thing i would say about actually going to dalesford is their pick and mix snacks are so good um these are their salted makona almonds love these so i got two of those cuz i just e little things sometimes you know when youre like hungry throughout the day and you just want to grab a handful of something and just like just quash your hunger cravings but you want it to be something thats good and wholesome thats why ive got two of those then the salted broad beans i do quite like these as well and then obviously for the sweet treat um the chocolate covered hazelnuts of course healthy meal for the foreseeable future that looks very very good i didnt do any meat oh was that just for you yes that is so delicious my goodness me very good oh my goodness that meat was unbelievable its definitely something that we need to do more of in terms of getting our meat from the butchers we have a really really good butchers in uh where we live but when you go somewhere and you just get to select your piece of meat and that im not even someone that like really understands or usually acknowledges the difference in the quality like not the quality but the taste oh my gosh that t the taste was incredible however ive just taken out my lunch for tomorrow because i started well for the first time ever i made my own turkey bone broth from uh the carcass of our christmas lunch so i just had some offcuts of vegetables and basically just popped it on in a pan simmered it for hours and it is so delicious i add a bit of a swirl of olive oil some lemon juice i have it with a slice of sourdough with butter and this is my dream lunch i also make sure that i get a little bit of the meat into the uh bone broth as well cuz thats what they do with the dalwood ones i still think the dalwood ones are absolutely incredible theyre so good to have in your fridge or even keep them frozen in your freezer barkley or even keep it frozen in the freezer so if you get the pouch and youre like oh i havent used that yet or maybe youve had meat during the week and youve made your own bone broth so you want to have that fresh freeze it and then defrost it and have it another day they are so good for that but what i want to definitely do is especially using my own veg from the kitchen garden which this year all of the posy vibes im going to have so much the off cuts and bits and pieces like that i literally just put the bone broth and freeze it um into these jars these are leftover from honey that weve had they freeze perfectly i just take them out the night before this will be defrosted in the fridge uh by lunchtime tomorrow and that is one portion as well which i am so happy with well good morning midwinter it has officially begun look at those pink skies barkley is absolutely beside himself for a walk this morning come on you come on py stop holding up the team come on my love come on youre doing amazing come on my love good boy good boy im off we go oh my gosh wow that is a look isnt it i have literally just woken up and we had a bit of a late night last night um later than planned and ally has gone off this morning to golf and i am out with the do the dogs the doges pink nose and all but there was no way that i was missing this morning because this is in my well is the first day that weve got where it has been very very wintry um if you remember there was a few days and i feel like thats usually the case theres like a few days in winter in november where you get cold weather and that happened whil we were in germany there was like snow and there was a really like frosty frosty couple of days and there was some snow when we got back but it wasnt cold enough for the snow to last and so to have that really wintry feeling i feel like ive missed out on so far so to wake up to what is the first proper frost of the year is really really exciting for me and i know that sounds weird um but i take great joy in experiencing the beauty of the seasons sorry im just checking that porter is all right hes not been out in the frost for a while and hes usually okay barkley fine i just want to make sure his pors are okay yeah i think hes okay um we are up with the sun at the moment just behind the camera the sun is just coming up weve got beautiful pink skies which youre probably not getting the full view of as you can hear my voice is um apparently on its way out at the moment im not too sure what thats about but this like illness has just lingered um but the reason why i get excited for this type of weather at this time of year and i know i was talking about this yesterday is because to me it feels like a new chapter or a new moment and its why in my book evergreen the chapters are separated by the seasons because every season there is something fresh and new and exciting to see and even just now if i get down here like we showed you the other day if you look at this look at that that is artwork right there yes porter is modeling it for us that is artwork nature created that how you couldnt you couldnt create something so beautifully if you tried i know i couldnt and thats just happened from the weather done nothing and what i found when i was having a difficult time in my life was stopping and noticing these things like the fact that a bit of water and some cold temperatures has happened overnight and in turn something that is absolutely miraculous has just occurred made me realize how insignificant so many of the things that i was experiencing and that i was worrying about how ins significant they actually were and how small i was in this world that keeps going and the seasons keep changing and the world keeps turning and nature keeps renewing and shedding and renewing and shedding and it was this sudden realization that id spent the majority of my life so wrapped up in my own head and my own thoughts that i had ignored the world and nature and the beauty around me and stopping regularly on a regular basis and having to take stock and appreciate what is happening completely out of my control all of the time was the most grounding and calming experience of my life no matter what was going on in it nothing is it was just unbelievable and so getting out for the first time in this weather we today is honestly my my dream i feel so lucky and ive got my two amazing sausage dogs pory and barkley with me for the ride what a applause treat sorry prime example there i take my camera with me and i take pictures of nature and it is one of those things that i have take taken great joy in and have been loving sharing it with you and so every so often ive sort of got my camera out and im like oh sorry im vlogging but i need to be taking pictures like right now there is so much to take pictures of i am well sometimes on these walk i cant even talk this is the first time im talking sometimes on these walks um it can be a winnie the p esque walk but on this walk it was very much an animals of farthing wood esque walk we saw foxes pheasants deer red kites sheep bunny rabbits everything and i hardly captured any of it because i can barely talk and i was just enjoying it look at my little pink nose hello hello yeah i think i think thats the thing for me is that i would obviously ive mentioned it in my video that im like i i think because ive experienced what its like to have a horse at my disposal should i say probably the right word to use but to to use as much and now go without im like oh this is really tough and im really frustrated and and then i thought about i was talking to my friend the other day and my friend was like but lydia if you had a baby no ones going to give you a baby to get used to it before having a baby so whats the difference with having a horse and i was like thats a very good point but im also in the position where im super lucky that ive got claudia whos coming with me tomorrow because she i i i honestly yes but shes also shes just shes basically just mentoring me through the whole process oh my goodness what a glorious morning oh wow that was quite the start of the day um ive got the gardener in the garden at the moment but i i have the house to myself which is such a treat i feel a little bit like um but i obviously wanted to catch up post sort of christmas and new year and just i dont know i dont even know what im going to say but i apologize i was just jumping on a call then because i have something planned tomorrow and i will let you know all about it in my next video but i think it will probably lean into what im talking about in this video anyway in that like i said when i was in the car um i havent noted down or i havent really felt the need music to really i dont know what the word is i feel my start to feels different to last year it feels calm and peaceful and i want that to continue and i dont want to hit the ground running and firing on all cylinders when at this time of year it is a time for rest and a time to hibernate its going to get colder we are obviously seeing um weather reports at the moment for a lot of snow and coldness and so its very much a bit of a baton down the hatches time of year and i feel like i learned so much at the end of last year in my approach to december and vlogmas and things like that i i i loved it and i loved it because i felt like i was just doing what was right for me and at no stage did i feel like i was missing out on anything and im going into with that same thats the gardener and so i guess what im trying to say is that i still have goals there are still things that i want to achieve i want to finish off downstairs i want to hopefully whether its this year or next year find a new house i um have business goals i really one of the things i really want to focus on for the year is my investing this is something that ive not really ever talked about in too much detail and probably wont ever on my channel cuz its just not what my channel is about but i am a what my husband describes as a serial angel investor and i looked at what i was doing online a few years ago and there was a period of time where
dRqVJPxnqh0,closet confessions culling season fashion haul trinny,welcome to clet confessions you mind behind the camera im only myself this is beginning of culling okay now today were going to ruthlessly and this is why molly is here as well look at each category and think when do you last wear that you keep putting it back in your wardrobe but youre not wearing it but the point of this is im getting to a stage where i want to be able to see more clearly what i can wear more of so there is um a stat that we wear of our wardrobe of the time there is a that i wear erratically and i think i want to just move it on out and then put it either in the king tr sale donate it for um oxfam give it to friends and family and work colleagues there might be a vinted moment cuz the sale for the kings trust is going to be really high in designer great where are we starting go and get something for me that you think i should get rid of here i tried to do this remember i took yeah m no no no thats good thats good because that might be on my list and first of all this yes i got it so its sad for me but yes youve never worn it pack offf hm unisex so its a weird cut its very broad but its narrow at the hip it had a button that was too high we took it off that was one rout co co co co okay oh yeah we got one we got one were going to get at least things here yes because i bought the brown boots for this to go with but i have never worn it i cannot bear that ive never worn it its just a very straight leg for a suit and youre not normally and im not doing that anymore and in c roy i would like will i ever go back i think i my for a i want to think about everything else i love you do okay let me just check let me just check i love i love i love i love love next section im going to say yeah and this was something somebody stared me in but i want them all day and i thought no its not me thats going okay i have here two sizes of the same child but i worn them a lot why youve eaten a lot in the evening you get changed no no im just saying i bought one and it was too tight i went to return it and it was too late so i bought the next size up okay so the the two small ones should go on the rail to be sold yeah andess you when did you buy them never dont those black i wear then we get on to black narrow trouser of which you have a few thats a handy one with the strip when youre suddenly allowing it its exactly the same shade as the cord yeah but you know i like black so im going to always think i think theyre very wearable um the l avia ones ive worn the ones i wear these are serena vi which i havent worn for ages this is awake mode these are me andm joggings like this barley one these i havent worn for ages because i have a sh theyre more of a summer trouser in the trousers and ive worn them for two the last two summers oh okay but i feel they have merit and theyll come back in i still feel theres opportunity maybe need to take out something else to keep those in so i havent wor this yet but i do like the shape of the skirt in skirt did you wear it at christmas when you thought you would wear it sorry i forgot to i forgot to take it i cant wait to wear this at forgot to take it okay thats going to go on my trip where im going away for a few days yes um skiing and in the evening i can wear it with a cashmir jumper i think that has really good m yeah okay these are trousers i travel in this i love these are this i love do you think yeah this could get some more mesh on it but it could its broken i havent picked this up because theres a big rip in it so it needs to go to be mended this is summerish but i dont know about that one it is being this methodical done that so i bought these shoes second hand best i collect i love it but ive never worn them youve never worn those as well which the dre these i wore al all holiday every night just love these wasnt on your holiday i wasnt invited on them butly enough it was a real test and i and they went with so much stuff no no i think youve got better silver heels i yeah cuz i think i dont like this if if that was one piece i think id like it better so they go back to besier they they go for another round for somebody else recycling y thats good um if we look at my silver boot collection now i just want to bring our attention to my silver boot collection because i was when i was with bella today and she was saying i so love this idea of a um trouser tucked into a boot i love and i could do this this is a new look i could do for this year all right so i have got three pairs of silver boots so im just going to talk about the merit so i do wear these with this and with a lot of lengths where i need a heel and i want a roundish toast those are really good mhm the things i havent worn apart from with a wid leg jeans is that but i think if i have my wide leg jeans which are really long this is a great thing to wear underneath its quite comfortable i think this is a forever piece and as long as i can walk in these yeah can we talk about the ones in the corner which ones you dont wear these but you wear them for a long like i did and you know what i brought them up again from downstairs because i thought last chance sunday you like so i havt introduced the team yet to my um friends but i love these i just have to show you whil im here but this is theyre just fabulous and theyre so theyre so eccentric and mad but its not on a rainy day its not on the dirty street its literally carry them in your handbag and then put them on as you go in the h the house of when i put these on now and these have been my best friend for so long i see martha stewart who is phenomena these are the only shoes she wears so what i do appreciate is when you get to maras age which im only years away from and you wear a heel this is the heel that will last you all evening this make this brand this robert clery the cushioning the fact its a wedge if you want to do a heel there will be a stage when im perhaps when that will not work for me anymore mhm but this will always work for me and these have been around as a shape since the s so this one is odly the one i like the most because i like the the fabrics together odly also the one you wore the least i think storage mhm oh okay so storage is going to be cuz you were going to optimistic say these g storage then you change your mind why you see how difficult she makes it for me i know you were here to be ruthless you know whats also gone is my leopard print manolo where they go theyre going to go to sale

really co its with this outfit its nice yeah it is nice its it is you know um this its been on a lot yeah but do you wear it apart from yeah sentimentally i hold on it yeah because the cut is so beautiful but whenever i put it on one of my favorite pictures from triny london is me in this when we did the launch of the line to define yeah and putting it on now its so sheap it was really cool it was in one of your press shots as well wasnt it and its so such a cool color its just a very cool pce would you ever do it with the awake mode skirt i could easily do it with the awake mode skir ch

put it on because its a suit a mans suit and the trousers dont fit me anymore let go let go let go this ro is filling up this is impressive im going to go straight to these because the colors they will go straight to lla because she really theyre her colors what about these colors this i wear a lot is is good it does work this color does work i know it does it does work that does work as well i do wear its because youre neutral that they do suit you know they do and ill keep thats look how washed out and i look in this it should suit me cuz its ecru as this is a seethrough form of e crew it looks creamier and i shouldnt wear it oh this its fine its nice look at its all real no now scars very quick this its time to say goodbye really yeah i think it has merit but maybe not right now yeah

takeaways lets do the takeaways of this when youre culling youve its good to think of these categories we want to think about so were going to think about what were going to take pictures of that weve weve bought and were not going to wear and were going to sell take pictures of that put them in your phone make sure you remember that and its called whats the acronym d uh then weve got things were going to sell at um bester collect or something oxam were going to give away friends were going to give away you could say some things for me for the kings um trust sale and really have friends in the room with you if you do it by yourself youll either be weak in your determination or youll call too much and then somebody needs to remind you you did actually love it and you still wear it or youll get distracted yeah and then you got to do it for each other so you could say you do it for me and ill do it for you and well spend half her sunday together and then do that ti okay thats about it i think the rest can wait till another day thanks joura thank you its been a pleasure molly thank you for your ruthlessness
UidnEGXwZRk,why timeless fashion is boring,when youre young theres this innate desire to be cool you want to look cool obviously you want to listen to cool music you want to do cool things you want to have cool stuff theres just this need to prove yourself like why do people even get into fashion in the first place and its undeniably fun but as you grow up all of this kind of just starts to change you know you get a little jaded you start to gravitate towards stability you know that that extra leg room in that rav starts to look more welcoming than that ferrari that you wanted to cry in your pastimes become more wholesome you know your interests become less material and more spiritual and undeniably the way you dress tends to follow suit you know and a lot of people find this disgusting especially if youre young right like why would you ever want to leave this colorful and exciting lifestyle you just you cant even fathom ending up in some crap like this hey im with you man i mean i just turned last month i have officially achieved un status i feel like late s it just sunk in oh like you know they say time is undefeated but why does that teams uniform have to be so boring i think the one thing thats truly killing trends at break neck speed is the idea of exhaustion through exposure visually weve become exhausted faster than ever like the ability to create anything you want to imagine exists at your fingertips now i mean its kind of insane when you think about it that way and sneakily that takes away the novelty of any sort of visual presentation but the one thing that we still lack the ability to play god in is the sister dimension to vision scent theres still something so primal and undeniably memorable about a good scent i dont even remember the last brain rot video that i watched minutes ago but i know i did watch something like this is this is what it was right this would fold like okay you know that meme of were like oh imagine showing this to a victorian era child but then thats kind of like the whole day now i dont even remember any of this and this is just from my recent reels but see what i do remember is i remember what she smelled like when i met her and man its so crazy because its just so insane how these two things have such polarizing efficacies when even though clearly one is way more insane than the other one and yeah man game is game and that is why ive been using the spawn of todays video scent bird for over years now because they wont remember what you wore theyre going to remember what you smelled like and i believe that sent bird is a monthly subscription service that lets you sample hundreds of designer fragrances without having to commit all of that time and money into just one bottle cuz like i said we we we make the choices but each scent will come in this vial and each vial is graded for about sprays so lets say you spray yourself maybe twice a day sprays divided by two sprays a day day thats about days per vial and you will be surprised how long these last i have a rotation of three right now with this first one being grained by perfumology its a little more masculine than what i would usually do but i feel like right now i dont know it just kind of fits the vibe maybe it fits the winter arc im just trying to try something new next is sandalwood musk by experimental perfume club another warm one that i feel like works really well with an all black fit i i cant really explain it but that is just the vibe of that one and the last one is sexual steel by michelle germain the secret weapon especially in a social setting its very distinct you can pick me out in a room like instantly uh but again everyone will have different taste here too just like everything so you can go on the senent bird website and actually just take a quiz based on your preferences and your lifestyle and it will determine your scent profile and then give you recommendations on what you should try but yeah go sign up for s bird now and go figure out what works for you and make sure you use code christian off for off your first month making a day vial around so go sign up for sener now everything is in the description remember use code christian off now youre welcome ahead of time thank you to sener for sponsoring todays video when you think of a timeless piece right i feel like naturally everyone just visually goes to a very boring and steril palette corporate suits button downs just regular very regular bland clothing but even though we all unanimously deem these things boring right like why do we eventually return to them like in the s and s we saw this over corrective reaction to s minimalism all these bright colors exaggerated detailing is about as maximalist as you can get while still appealing to the masses but nowadays were seeing the rise of like loafers bro we are so back could you imagine this stuff years ago and dude and mules too like this like i remember four years ago the dad sho thing was like a cultural anomaly and now were just were just full postmodern crash out you know like taking the stairs right were jumping out of the window but for efficiency but at the root of all these trends right here right theres always a timeless template like right here obviously tailoring you know classic footwear at the core these items would be deemed pretty boring but i dont think the idea of timeless and tasteful are mutually exclusive we all know taste is an ever evolving subjective matter like that is all on you the way that you see the world and the way that you want to express your interpretation like that is your taste that is your problem but the idea of timeless has this weird gray area between the subjective and objective world like how a good fitting pair of denim is timeless for any era objectively good peace but what is good fitting right like i dont know like what does that even mean what is good what is good fit guys what the are we even talking about or how you know a basic pair of black leather boots will stand the test of time stylewise and build wise but again with all these things right theres still this subjective element here where it depends on how its styled like that jeans example i just had right the s its probably the same exact pair of jeans from the s but the subjective context is different you know like its the same ingredient but a completely different dish like the same alpha industries bomber was used in war is now widely deemed as a product of fashion with you know even their brands focus really leaning into this youthful fashionable market but it still utilizes the same designs from its genesis its the same piece different machine like trench coats right why do you think theyre called trench coats which leads me to the point that maybe this timeless piece isnt necessarily boring maybe youre just boring nuance nuance nuance nuance a lot of the magic of styling comes in nuance and when youre only throwing hail marys and shooting three pointers from the logo when it comes to style you you you will have no idea what its actually like to play in the paint with nuance how to cash in on the exponentially higher ceiling and longevity of nuance like these things might just seem boring because maybe you lack the perspective to understand and utilize but regardless of your style or direction i feel like it is infinitely beneficial to have perspective on the little things cuz like i said earlier the idea of being visually jaded everyone at some point will eventually start to get tired of that whole big inyour face means of expression it just becomes the older you get it just becomes annoying you know its like why are you so fuing loud dude and then eventually you start to come back down just fundamentals just timeless basic things that get the job done man that phrase get the job done right is that derogatory almost but with fundamentals nuance plays such a big factor in that all right guys im going to lets bring it back so you know the idea of sauce sauce right this intangible substance that separates the idea of crushingly mediocre from tastefully effective see sauce is kind of just the sister of nuance also they even look the same written out like a taller mature older sibling you know for example right this basic jumper right here timeless piece just i dont ever see how something this ubiquitous can get phased out and the difference between a tasteful one and a boring one is so nuanced for example these two right here right b just based on your gut feeling which one has more sauce and just think about it for a second right just take a look at these two which one has more sauce right ill be honest man i have noing clue im filming in front of a green screen and most of the time actually fing all the time i i actually have no idea what asset im using on screen at any given time and im just hoping that it comes together and post so for whenever im asking you a question like i genuinely dont even know what the im talking about a lot of the times and even like now like uh yeah i mean most hey guys its me two days into the future editing this video and the way i make these videos is i usually have a couple talking points and then i just press record on the camera and hope for the best and since ive been doing it for so long usually theres enough material to make up a video but this time as im watching it back i realized that i just totally forgot to get back to the point and did not talk about anything productive heres a time lapse of me talking to myself um the audio is pretty useless somethings got to give and i think its going to be me you know and man if you could hear the audio for this its kind of impressive i mean its kind of cool i guess i dont know any anyways so im just going to do this um but this is kind of cool cuz i can see what im looking at so i have these two jumpers right here right theres nothing crazy about theyre just regular stuff but of the two which one has more sauce its kind of an interesting idea because you cant really describe it ill give you a couple seconds to figure out what im talking about you know and you know which one im talking about stop being stupid and its kind of weird how this one right here is just oddly a little bit better even though theyre kind of almost the same thing and you can kind of point out the visual differences like maybe the color is more seasoned on one or whatever you know but its so new on that you dont even know why your brain perceives it is more interesting you know theres its just such small changes and that is all i had to say and instead of that i just anyways back to the green screen meat yeah im not including any of that anyway so what are we talking about nuance its cool to see the the all the potent yet unexplainable parts of nuance in this example that im totally aware of right lets do another one right another example a piece that people would probably deem boring or even ugly man im sure the future me will figure this out again because again i i have no clue what im even talking about y so ow anyways the point i was trying to make my latest obsession in fashion right now is long sleeves and just any kind of long sleeve just long sleeve shirts jumpers and i think the reason i like it so much is that theres such regular pieces on the outside right like look you know just a regular long sleeve like what are we even talking about you know but with minor tweaks to things such as color fit fabric or even just vibe you know these things end up being my favorite pieces in my wardrobe and im you know like dude like this is all i fing wear now and this ones just a military thermal from the s but you see what im talking about here is theres so much you can do with these timeless building blocks if you just get around and playing with the nuance details of these things and with that timeless factor right like how does a long sleeve get played out its like its like the idea of rice getting played out cuz obviously this looks pretty boring compared to this crap thats happening right now everywhere but if once you figure out how to make more with less youll just never really have to worry about style expiring ever again and that really is the idea of timeless man i really hope this helps cuz im so tired of of filming these dude i i mean i honestly dont mind this webcam because then i can kind of see what im talking about actively so maybe i might do a whole video like this honestly do i have anything else to say i mean i feel like yeah i think thats the whole i think uh i think the i think thats it

ISSgIDnq410,the key fashion trends wearable spring summer trend edit,music hello everyone today ill be sharing the key fashion trends you need to know this season a weareable spring summer trend edit that you can easily integrate into your own everyday outfit ideas sharing how i will be styling these trends and how you can make them work with your existing wardrobe well be talking jewelry trends and how ill be mixing up my pandora pieces for an uptodate look plus ive done the research for you and well be sharing where you can shop the trends for less across the high street so please do sit back relax and lets delve into all that beautiful fashion that you might want to try out for spring summer move over barbie core the fashion trends have a more subtle and altogether more wearable color on the scene elegant shades of pastel pink were seen everywhere on the catwalk from the liks of her dam prada chanel jason woo kate and brandon maxwell to name but a few and i for one im very very happy about it think about silks and satins in these softer more delicate shades of pinks and maybe look out for embellishments if you wanted to add a touch of the bohemian vibe or perhaps something more structured if you want to take it down a l su lunch aesthetic now if pink alone feels a little bit too much for you i would think about layering these looks with a collection of other soft neutrals perhaps like beiges and blues and camels just so you get a hint of the pastel pink underneath and you give a nod to that fashion tr but it doesnt feel like the shade is overwhelming you its a little bit whimsical and romantic and feels really light and floaty for spring summer and the shade does mix so well with all of my other pieces that ive already got in my wardrobe definitely one of my favorites this season now it wouldnt be spring summer fashion if there wasnt some element of bohemian style running through it but this year the essence is less ethereal and more individual than ever before seen on the runways from the likes of valentino fendy chloe and isabelle to name but a few the style hit a really free spirited yet original note with quirky layering and unusual detailing i personally especially love the valentino and chloe shows which conjured up a mix of s folk meets a classic sienna miller off duty kind of style this year id just be looking for those standout details like fastening your blazer with a satin bow like i have today or you could look for dresses adorned with embellishments or lace or embroidery for a real focus on those finer details its a look thats really really easy to recreate from the high street too and i do find that the layering element can make the overall look feel so much more individual to you as well just to confirm i am very much the opposite as a working one of three however i really do like the style sometimes even though its completely different say to the bohemian aesthetic side note to add here dont be fooled into thinking that you have to choose one look for your entire wardrobe ie you like the bohemian style so everything in your wardrobe needs to look very bohemian i might wear five different styles in any given week and i love the freedom and the variety of that so dont let society pigeon hole you into just one look so anyway yes the ladies who lunch trend is obviously very elegant and no big surprises was seen on the runway from the likes of chanel gucci louis vuitton to name but a few now its obviously very similar to the quiet luxury trend but it definitely has more of an edge for and an easy way to interpret this fashion trend into your own everyday wardrobe would be to search for elements of tweed or if you dont have any i found a few pieces already across the high street tweed of course is very synonymous with the ladies who lunch aesthetic but it doesnt have to be so old school and a little bit twe think about contrasts and adding in those quirky elements to really bring the look up to date now as you might have noticed with those last couple of outfits jewelry for spring summer has definitely taken on a more is more beman aesthetic for and thankfully pandora have just about everything i need to create this really individual looking fashion trend one that i will definitely be wearing myself this season so taking inspiration from the runways i knew i wanted to focus on layering and charms this particular season so i thought about mixing up my pieces to create my own original look so i started with my pandora essence collection with this organically shaped pearl necklace one of my favorites coincidentally that i tend to wear on repeat i then added in this karat goldplated heart pendant and i connected a little studded clip charm to add a little bit more length and width then i added in a little more pearl with this pretty sun charm and a hint of sparkle with the parve the overall effect is just my perfect bohemian style pendant necklace thats truly original to me and it gives a heavy nod to the fashion trends while im doing it now i would either wear it alone like i am today or you could layer your layers of jewelry instead so you can see here the slightly shorter necklace im wearing is my freshwater pearl and parve necklace which ive simply doubled up i really like layers in threes so i opted for another element of pearl and gold with this final pendant that is actually a baroque pearl ring this was a present for me actually but it came up a little bit big so rather than have it amended ive changed the shape slightly and made it into a pendant instead and actually i really really love the effect pandora is one of my absolute favorite brands full stop but when it comes to their jewelry style they really tick all the boxes for me so at the end of this video please do click the links that ive added in the description box below and have a go creating your own individual jewelry with charms and pendants from a beautiful collection at pandora thankfully theres a couple of fashion trends lots of us invested in an autumn winter that will be sticking around for the foreseeable love it when that happens caramel suede was of course huge last year so its really nice to see the likes of prada still sending this down the runway not a super affordable investment piece i know so very much appreciated when they stick around for a little bit longer and thinking of all those lovely caramel brown tones that we were all wearing dont stick any of them on vintage just yet because its absolutely one of the colors of spring music to my ears as i really love those brown shades so anyone else very excited about this one sticking around for a little bit longer and stripes quite probably my most war print in my entire wardrobe will also be staying with us for spring summer and well yes any stripe will absolutely do the trick searching your wardrobe for vertical stripes even pin stripes does bring the trend super up to date now tied up in with the new bohemian fashion trend would be the abundance of sheer fabric seen from so many designers this season including chanel totam chloe tibby brandon maxwell ral luren i could go on and on you get the idea if you invest in one type of fabric detailing this spring summer i would advise making it sheer now when we talk about sheer fabrics i know a lot of people want to recoil in horror but i am not suggesting a totally seethrough number however pretty it might be being wearable for your everyday life but what you can do is interpret the fashion trend with the smaller elements within your own outfits maybe a sheer collarbone for example which i think can look incredibly elegant sheer sleeves can have a really beautiful effect think about layering share pieces like chiffon and chw all together to get the essence of the aesthetic but its not actually seethrough at all shar done well can be incredibly pretty and its definitely a look that im personally really excited about having a go recreating this spring summer are you a yay or nay on this particular fashion trend do let me know in the comments below now one fashion trend that would be new to my own wardrobe would be played the jewelry is out so far whether it will actually suit me or not so i do need to have a bit of a play with the styling on this one myself and see how wearable i actually find it but thanks to the row isabelle and clean estrada play checks are most definitely one of the big fashion trends this season whether we like it or not i saw a really fun quote actually the other day that was talking about the checks this season and the fact that theyre much softer or almost veering into kind of pastel shades but with a nana meets country living kind of vibe that i could get into just a little reminder the best way you can support me and my channel is by giving this video a thumbs up and subscribing i share fashion videos every sunday and quick style tips on my youtube shorts to the more of the mario if you would like to join us for more style tips and outfit music ideas now imagine a classic s chint style wallpaper or curtains a lot of our grannys would have had that is the perfect kind of floral print thats going to be huge this spring summer seen from the likes of beta vanita clashing at versace and with peter panar at prada now im not usually one for too much print but there is something really warm and quite familiar about these types of florals that i personally really really like i was just about born in the s to be exact and i do distinctly remember a whole lot of chint going on in my own grandmas living room i recently actually found this vintage antique boutique floral dress on vintage and although i think i do need to have it a ed as its coming up a little bit big on me it is very s and that print is very bold for me and yet i absolutely love it you could of course take the trend more subtle than i have here and just add a hint with a blouse for example or one for the print maximalist out there you could perhaps consider clashing your florals which will give you an extra big tick in fashion easter steaks i feel like the designers have been trying to push this trend on us for years and try as they might year after year we the customer just arent getting it so i would look at those creations as the beautiful works of art that they obviously are and simply take an element from within it for your inspiration ie if you are looking for a new crop jacket this season what about opting for one that cinches in with a tie so it just creates a gentle puff ball shape have a good look through your own wardrobe perhaps and try restyling some of those puff sleeves that you might already have in new ways thats probably how ill be interpreting this one now when it comes to jeans im personally a big believer that simply wearing the shape that suits you best is the way to go however that being said there are five distinct fashion trends bubbling around this season and im thinking probably one of them might be what you already have in your wardrobe anyway so were all going to feel super on trend without actually having to try distressed jeans though yes on the catwalk as is often the case this could be quite extreme but it could also be a pair that are lovingly lived in lived in jeans are always the best anyhow so this is an easy box to tick drawring jeans not something ive got in my own wardrobe yet i must admit but equally a style that im interested to try out seamed jeans now i do like the idea of this either going quite bohemian style with maybe a slightly flared peir or perhaps on the flip side of that you could go with something quite sharper and quite elevated looking i think that would be a nice twist on the look that im imagining could be quite versatile too all the shades of gray another really easy style of jeans that a lot of us could tick as we saw everything from washed out almost black grays to something a whole lot lighter and quite embellished d monte jeans nope i am not doing it the dazzle jeans would be a definite no no for me and thinking of dressing our bottom halves the trend in trousers this year would definitely be a whole lot baggier well actually baggy for long trousers tight for capri and thanks to louis vuitton tight kneelength cycle shorts anyone no not for me either but baggy trousers with the smarter edge i could definitely get into we saw super long and beautifully tailored trousers at tory b and a slight s power suit kind of vibe at sun la ron and of course this is a fashion trend thats particularly easy to pick up across the high street with everyone from hm to aret co and the frankie shop are offering variations of the trend from all different price points styling wise i prefer to go for a high low approach with these quite voluminous pieces so i would style a really tailored pair of super baggy trousers with say a classic white tank and depending on what youre doing maybe just with a nice pair of heels simplicity for me always has the most impact and when you keep it really minimal it does feel a whole lot more comfortable to wear too the american preppy look has long been big for the last few years now particularly in spring actually and it doesnt look like its going anywhere fast but as with a lot of the fashion trends this season its all about taking those trends and as your own individual twist on them the more original the better this season layering your skirts over trousers was a particular look we saw at bet vanita with those distinct s preppy vibes at prada and tibby felt more s as well but a little bit more lowkey and yet with that original edge now if the idea of scants skirts or shorts over trousers reminds you way too much of your s school era like it does me keep it really simple instead classic preppy collars ribbed knit tops and a great pair of loafers will all give a nod to the preppy trend without it having to feel fullon regress into the years fashion we would all rather forget and thinking of the humble tank top they were of course featured heavily across the catwalk too as they always are really for spring summer but its interesting to see how these core staples have become so in fashion theyre no longer seen as just a bit of a filler item for your wardrobe but now they are happily taking center stage just like they were at dior and raban and theres no denying how much i use these core pieces in my own everyday outfits so its really worth getting the investment of those right as always my motto with this is simple buy less but buy those pieces in the highest quality i can afford i like thicker organic cottons for my tanks but i also actually really like when theyve got a linen blend just so you get that added bit of texture in the mix trainers with barely their souls will be one of the biggest fashion for spring summer now when i say barely their souls we are sadly in a way talking about boxing style trainers which i know arent the most attractive look in the world however drv van noons interpretation thankfully which was a lowp got the look spoton and has fast gained cultlike status among fashion easter another alternative would be to just go for classic nights which im thinking some of you have probably already gotten your wardrobe so weve got chocolate brown brown powder pink white of course is always in for spring summer and the other big color that were seeing all over the high street would be pistachio i wish id bought that coat in suzan now seen on the runways from the likes of tove chloe tibby and prada pistachio or just shades of mint will be all the rage the season and again like the pastel pink shades its a really lovely light and soft shade to wear that i know will certainly mix and match with my own wardrobe and im imagining lots of yours too on spring days i love the idea of layering maybe a silk cami with my highwaisted flare jeans and maybe just a thin cardigan over the top for an overall very free spirited kind of vibe or come the evening time as well actually id love to find a long mint satin dress or perhaps one with say a layer of super lightweight chiffon over the top to sort of bring in that sheer element and that way of course youre ticking a couple of different fashion trends in one thinking about it actually mint or pistacho does go really nicely with so many different colors i think youd find it a lot more versatile than you might first think for me on a personal level though i prefer to stay clear of black against those very soft pastel shades as i just find the contrast a little bit too jarring mint and chocolate brown however now that would definitely be my cup of tea the fashion trends according to beta vanita lou dior bbery and vivian westwood must include something asymmetric and actually its a surprisingly easy look to replicate even from the most affordable end of the high street i personally prefer asymmetrical shapes when theyre on my top half actually maybe a blouse with an interesting slant or a bow detail thats slightly off to one side skirts of course we often see with asymmetrical hemlines but in all honesty i have a bit of a strange ver version to them for some reason they always feel a little bit off however that is definitely a personal style quirk and just style roll if you actually like them and than is sports wear elevated as leisure was also a huge trend to hit the catwalks for spring summer so for everyone whos guilty of continuing to wear their gym kit hours after actually working out me included well now were just super on trend there was ballet and swim vibes from todds and even farigo tory bur and ralph lauren got in on the act now i think the trick to making this trend look cool and not altogether a little bit dar would be within the layering maybe a ballet style leotard with a long shift on skirt a fitted swim style body with a highwaisted pair of trousers mixing and matching separates like this and playing with the layering until you feel like youve got the balance right its fun and its not taking itself too seriously which i do really like and i bet these are also some of the comfiest outfits we could all wear there are so many great fashion trends about this spring summer that its really hard to fit them all into one video so heres a little rundown of the best of the rest that you might like to try out too animal print zebra leopard and snakes skin made an appearance on the runways and i hazard a guess we could all take this box somehow from within the depths of our existing wardrobe dark gothic looks were seen on the catwalk from the likes of rick owens and valentino the perfect antidote to all that powder pink if thats more your style and utility always a favorite in spring summer will indeed be big again for i would think about tones of cary camel and olive and look out for utility style pocket details to give just a little nod to the tr bows will be big too either added onto your clothes or worn in your hair for a very pretty but up to dat edge elevated leggings we saw too ones that wed actually want to wear out were shown in abundance at tibby totem and son rail it is in short the season to be your wonderful individual freespirited self and like i always say i find knowing the fashion trends each season really really helpful but the theme of this particular season is all about originality so take those trends and see if you can reimagine them in a way that truly matches

starting with a high enough heat if a recipe calls for a hot pan put it on early so it gets smoking hot and always remember to preheat your oven at least minutes before cooking a clean cook is an efficient cook my tip for a tidy cooking area is to always have a waste bowl next to you it saves you going back and forth to the bin never add salt to eggs before cooking them because it ruins the texture and dulls the color instead save your seasoning to the very end music the key to cooking meat is to make sure its at room temperature before you begin cook straight from the fridge the mussel fibres will be tight which results in tough meat and always let it rest afterwards so it relaxes becoming tender and juicy how to deseed chili to get the seeds out hold it upright and just rub the

following technique and ill show you how weve got these original graters really important when we use this we use the the fine zester not the big rough one not the one for slicing and not the other one for grating this little one here onto a plate because its always easier to lift off from the plate than it is the board and the most important thing about zesting a lemon is nice long strokes but twisting the lemon round every time we go down we twist same with the orange and same with the line a little tap if you go too far let me just show you look you got that white bitter piff that destroys the wonderful zesty flavor and look thats what were looking for there this really nice vibrant lemon zest delicious garlic is a key ingredient in so many spicy dishes my tip for finely chopping a mincing is add a pinch of salt for abrasion which helps break the fibers of the garlic down for a much better result for getting the most out of root ginger simply remove the skin using a

are cooked the outside wont be falling apart and when youre cooking potatoes always cook extra so theres leftovers theyre fantastic to have on hand for making my delicious gnocchi and potato rosters for a classic bubbling squeak with how to skin and debone a fish the hasslefree way this is basically a filleted side of salmon its been taken off the bone and now skin off pick up your knife a really nice broad flexible filleting knife a little sharpen lift up the base of the towel and then just nick a little bit at the end there twist the knife almost as if its horizontally underneath the salmon pull the skin and you slice the salmon underneath and let the knife do the work now get your skin flip it back over and check youre not leaving too much salmon on top of the skin pull it back and nice and slowly get the skin wrap it around your fingers pull the salmon towards you and then just all the way through lay that down one nicely skinned salmon just like a perfect snakeskin get your knife and just run the knife down and then with a pair of tweezers these are fish tweezers but you can use normal tweezers look for the head up and pull and with the skin being removed from underneath the salmon the pin bones come out a lot easier the pinboards only go to just basically halfway along the fillet one nice fillet of salmon beautiful music theres still plenty of flavor in the trimmings from affiliated fish my tip is dont waste those fish bones add to water wine a bay leaf and some chopped veg to make a simple but versatile fish talk at home the perfect base for a delicious fish soup music a great tip for intensely flavored stressfree veg is to steam them in their own juices simply add to a pan with a knob of butter and seasoning then cook on a low heat with a lid on to lock in the moisture music for crispy roast potatoes you can depend on my tip is to parboil them leave them to steam dry then sprinkle them with semolina or flour and give them a good roughing up this ensures they go really crispy in the oven a great tip for browning meat or fish is to dry with kitchen roll before you cook it then youll get a much better color too much moisture makes the meat steam instead of sear and youll lose that rich brown crust like the one i got on those sticky pork ribs my tip for amazing tuna capacho is to freeze it first and it will slice beautifully its wise to save leftover wine for cooking my tip is to freeze the remaining wine in freezer bags or ice cube trays its great in stocks and sauces music when you freeze soups or stews in tubs the tip is not to overfill them leave room to expand in the container a great tip for a cheese homemade ice cream buy a high quality vanilla ice cream and make it your own by mixing in berries chocolate or my favorite rum and boozy raisins music a fantastic tip for leftover lemons and limes is to cut them into wedges freeze and use them like ice cubes they wont water down your drink and theyll also add flavor first up how to join the chicken for your favorite real fast food dishes open up the legs and just pierce the skin there careful not to cut into the breast and hand on top of the breast and pull the drum back pop out

center of the carcass and therefore theres no waste and look we end up taking off these plump chicken breasts nice two drums two thighs two wings two breaths of chicken and one amazing carcass for a stock and not an ounce of waste a great tip to stop your skewers burning when youre making kebabs is to soak them in water first or for skewers with added flavour strip your rosemary branches of their leaves and use instead music for no fuss marinading my tip is to place fish or meat in a plastic storage bag while they marinate its easy to store and theres less cleanup lime juice or lemon juice make great marinades my tip for getting maximum amount of juice from a lemon or lime is to roll it hard under your palm for a minute before juicing lemons are also useful for rice add a couple of drops of juice while you cook it to keep your grains looking nice white and bright i want to cut my steak rare so by touching the steak i want the same feedback as it is on the inside of my thumb thats rare as it starts to cook it gets a lot firmer medium is there semifirm with a slight resistance well done its there rare a great tip for getting meat or fish to cook faster is to score it which allows the heat to penetrate quicker this also allows marinades to be absorbed more deeply for stainfree tupperware coat it thinly with oil which acts as a barrier between plastic and food its so easy to make your own chili sherry to use in quick stirfries or sauces take mls of dry sherry such as fino and using a funnel pour into a sterilized bottle add five whole thai chilies seal with a cork or

indoors and move outside when theyre ready you

dumplings soup dumplings in my freezer i thought that would be a a a dream even to my grandchildren but no today and oh god its so nice to be back to where i can read boxes steam dumplings also known as xia long ba originated in the xangan region of china they are traditionally made with por con steamed and small bamboo steamer baskets our version comes in a convenient microwavable steamer tray each dumpling packs a strong punch of flavor due to the copious amounts of ginger that wasnt as fun as i was hoping i think that after you know back when this was trader mings because thats what it was was until a couple years ago i think theyre probably steering clear of any kind of l so im going to eat this like a proper soup dump put it in a spoon and im going to pierce it there is a little bit of liquid in there i kind of want to pour it out for demonstration i can pour it in the spoon that way its not gross there we go look at that oh there we go look at that just pissing out right there its just kind of excreting all right its got a little soup in there those are fantastic um the wrapper is definitely gummier than like a you know freshly made soup there was a frozen soup though what am i what am i what am i count dooku thats uh star wars star wars prequels reference right there thats for you they taste really good theyre a little tiny tiny tiny bit undersalted but like they they werent lying theres a punch of ginger in there theres a full punch and um its its really good im going to give these in eight were starting off real strong theyre very tasty i encourage you guys to eat one of these theyre not too hot too you shove the whole thing your right in your gullet its like a seagull or not a seagull a um whats the one with the pelican ah just just like a pelican all right next up we have chai which is a korean stir fried potato glass noodle with vegetables any stories on here nope again theyre not rolling those dice theyre like you know heres the food were not going to editorialize it at all its just this is the food doesnt say authentic anywhere what what would what would okay they used to call trader mexican trader joe stuff trader joses uh chinese trader joe stuff trader mings what would they call trader joes korean audience leave a comment cuz im not going to do it okay really great noodle texture super bouncy chewy just the way i like him needs more everything its very bland tasting down h look down look down all right so yeah no these are uh uh great texture but very undersalted needs something needs soy sauce i dont remember what goes in chai but like whatever it is it needs it uh it at the very least it needs salt um but hey you can do that you you you got time on your hands right i mean you saved some by microwaving this thing did you guys microwave this or bake it or what microwave uh yeah no if youre looking for a glutenfree noodle option cant do much better than this these have a fantastic texture some of them are really chewy and bouncy some arent its good but it it needs stuff it theres lots of room for improvement ill give these a six am i mean am i heartless ill give these a six yes i am mean and heartless beef tamales uh wrapped in corn husks trader joes no funny business you want stories and anecdotes look at the mac and cheese and the italian stuff inspected and passed by the department of agriculture culture you dont see that every day on food ive in fact i dont think ive ever seen that i appreciate it thats good to know theres cilantro in it these i think were microwaved so just bear that in mind these look like good to moles all i have her chopsticks in a spoon and uh ooh its hot now oh smoking those was pretty good um again a little under salted might be an illusion because its so hot dont know if you know that but foods taste less salty when theyre super hot little known fact kendall taught it to me so i actually dont know if its like true but its been my experience and isnt that the only objective fact is subjective experience thats the grand irony so these are good the the the texture is solid theyre not as like el dente as i would like for them to be i dont know i wonder what the what what spanish is for al dente googles just like you mean italian right all right spanish for to some delicios stupid stupid stupid um i wish they were more alente they not uh but the the the flavor solid again maybe slightly undersalted let me try some now that its cooled off a little bit you know it hasnt i mean my biggest complaint is hard to eat with chopsticks yeah no could use a little bit of salt but like youre going youre going to sauce this right nothing special but nothing bad is that a six no its its its solid it tastes like like theres no it doesnt taste like preservative its got a decent texture its got a good flavor its loaded with beef how much does this cost for two tamales thats thats a little thats a little thats a little but whatever theyre good ill give them a seven scall and pancakes or pum keep frozen thats all we have to say were going to put some decorative flowers on the outside but these are agnostic this could be wallpaper in your moms house or it could be a beautiful lotus flower in a culturally appropriate just just pleas just eat this just just enjoy the pancakes its fine um wow they feel a little crispy were these microwaved oh well that makes more sense cuz theyre a little crispy thats definitely going to be the way to heat these up because they definitely feel crisp and they would definitely be mushy if you mik waved them lets see what happens m thats good now these are fantastic um theyre thin enough that theyre mostly crust so they just pretty much just have a fantastic te texture scall and pancakes usually pretty mushy in the side anyway try a little bit on its own just uh to be agnostic again und salted but youre dipping it in liquid salt soy sauce so thats fine these are delicious im going to give them an eight theyre very good skying pancakes all right next up we have cheese and green chili tamales wrapped in corn husks keep frozen and it looks like they do indeed have green chilies and it looks ooh look at that cheesy stretchy cheesiness look at that oh yeah just got interesting okay lets see what were dealing with here what maybe im just salt blind or something cuz i feel like everythings been undersalted thus far this feels undersalted but you threw some salsa on there uh we found out the actual word for um tooth sim in spanish which is sabrosa which frankly sounds beautiful um these are quite tasty they need something sala but so do most tamales uh same solid texture i like the filling better it tastes kind of like hatch chilies or or pablano chilies theyre very flavorful nice chilies just a bare suggestion of heat solid amount of melty nice melty cheese great texture great tamale im going to give these a do they deserve an eight im going to give these a uh im going to give them a seven theyre bump up oh we have our first double feature ladies and gentlemen just like the old days the drivein we have our f we have we have vegan tikka masala what the hell are these objects in it if its not vegan meat substitute soy meat in a a tika masala sauce it looks not like tika masala if im being honest maybe once i mix it up and i get that oil incorporated and im having it with a tor naan this is imported authentic thats youre youre treading a fine line but where was it made thats what i want to know product of india pretty hard to say its yeah no yeah you know what its authentic this is real so uh all right we have an authentic naan and we have a vegan tikka mage sal everything today will be eaten with chapsticks this is a really oily uh tial im trying to reincorporate the oil into the sauce and it is fighting me its fighting me like a like a like a big mouth bass it doesnt want to get reeled in but i am stronger there we go that also looks crazy hot so im just going to dig right in okay who might have just had a little bit too much time in the oven but thats okay uh so the soy nuggets are terrible they have what i would describe as a bouncy slippery texture no if if this if this were chicken i would call the hospital because id be like i just ate chicken thats clearly you know has rabies and im going to die a couple hours ago and uh theyd be like sir you know its just soy prot isolate and i id be like this na is a little dry can you please send the police nas a little dry might have just spent a little bit too much time in the oven its also not very toothsome its very tender what whats the indian word for toothsome hindi word for toothsome is mazadar its not very mazadar its pretty pretty tender uh and a little so not like a na that youd get from a restaurant those things are positively stretchy you got to you got you got to put some put some whatever these muscles are into tearing those in half but this okay that didnt look just trust me its a little theyre theyre tender uh the sauce is okay so oily even after incorporating the oil its separating again so much oil i didnt try the rice lets lets see what the rice is all about it looks not very good oh once it mix it up it looks better all right the the rice is like pretty well cooked it is aromatic basmati it has that lovely jasmine flavor and um the only really bad thing about this is the pro protein chunks i wont be so mean ill give the naan a five and ill give this a four cuz this is not so great and i even though this isnt the best na ive ever had i would keep eating it its bread its fine all right next up we have roasted eggplant curry very hard to eat with chapsticks sorry ill use a spoon h interesting ooh its spicy okay that is well seasoned it really tastes like distinctly of eggplant despite the fact that theres a billion spices and a solid amount of heat in there like id rate this on a spicy scale jalapeno its its its showing up its punched in imagine its pretty good for you too yeah buddy calories in this container only gs of carbs g of protein whatever g of fat from what from what oh okay the fourth ingredient is oil theres a lot of oil in this fine whatever i dont care th this is really tasty but its like you know its a one trick pony but its really good it does its one trick very well so im gna give it im gonna give it an eight okay butter chicken the chicken your mama warned you about not sure what that means oh it smells delightful im going to try the sauce first on its own tastes distinctly of cinnamon pretty good um the chicken is lets see hot a little dry but it doesnt have that like freezer funk to it um its tasty its really very like cinnamon all spice forward theres some warming spice thats attacking me right now but i like it i asked it to you know the only issue with it is that the chickens dry i would give it an eight no its good and spicy too id give it a nine if the chicken were like great but i think this is going to be an eight because the sauce is really quite good solid as rock next up we have a taiwanese green onion pancakes ready to cook oh we have a story trader joes green onion pancakes are just like what you might get at a traditional dimsum meal quickly fried these savory discs become crispy and flaky and can be eaten on their own as a snack or used as part of a meal its a great tip uh try using them in place of a tortilla or non to wrap meats or vegetables thats actually a great that sounds delicious really great uh nice and flaky good layers good noises when i when i manipulate them like this lets try it out much cheerer a lot more there must be like in taiwanese style they must use more of a flour or something because theres a lot of yeah the top ingredient is flour and theres theres gluten development its got chew to it toothsomes the italians have words for alente no im kidding its just like they said um what uh es eskimos inuit have like words for snow i was just trying to make an eskimos have words for snow joke to some howe youre welcome uh these are these are good and howw um im definitely saying that wrong uh but on their own without the soy sauce virtually no flavor i barely taste green onion if at all it mostly just tastes like flour this would indeed make a fantastic wrap for meats or veggies as suggested by the container but on its own as a scallion pancake its not as tasty as the other ones it just has a way better texture these are a seven you dip these in some soy sauce with some sesame oil and some chili crisp or something youre youre youre youre walk on sunshine oh youre walking on sunshine pad seeu stir fried thai rice noodles with vegetables tofu and soy sauce i love padu uh and given trader joes history uh of of frozen noodle acumen i think that these are going to be quite good lets see if i have to look up another word for toothsome bummer bummer i do high word for toome erod oroy definitely pronouncing that correctly which simply means delicious stop it google ai im not looking for the word for delicious im looking for the word for tosm great this place has has a translation but its just the thai text theres no theres no pronunciation guide for people like me so its not this enough long story short the noodles are pretty mushy theyre not toothsome as as i would like them to be they they theyre let me try another one just in case i got a lemon that one was better cuz it was folded over multiple times so it had that like you know you know when pasta sticks together it gets extra chewy had that going on but the noodles the single sheet noodles theyre dead in the water super soft flavors okay carrots are mushy look the bach choy i assume really mushy and watery tofu is nice and soft and and tender thats cool really oily i mean pad is really oily it is an oily dish so im not going to hold that against it but im going to hold everything else against it and im going to give it a five i i would feel like that was a waste of calories if i ate this whole bowl shoot trying to watch my language recently sorry sorry about the shoot but there actually papas reas wow i went from saying it really wrong to really right crispy mashed potatoes stuffed with seasoned ground beef is this a real dish or is it some sort of traer generian invention yeah no these are a pop popular latin american croquet very cool something i had not heard of until today im committing o yeah that worked out really well so lets take a look at that crosssection we got a little smidgen of beef in there whole bunch of tater looks like some saucy sauce or something lets see what it tastes like this tastes exactly like theres this sandwich restaurant in my hometown called dellas and they have a sandwich they call it their sandwich oil its like its like a its like an italian oil basically its got oil with herbs in it and thats what this tastes like like precisely did you bake these nico uh yes thats why theyre so crispy theyre very very soft but theyre like so etheral its like i cant theyre halfway between mushy and fluffy there it is thats better the outside is really fantastically crisp for having been ovened rather than deep fried so these these reconstituted it very very well and um the flavor well again strange for me is objectively quite good theres a lot less beef than depicted on the on the box but whatever thats boxes for you so any any any story here do i get a little blurb no not today okay im going to give these a jeez im going to give am i going to give everything an eight does everything get an eight today no these are fine theyre going to get a seven these are a seven not because im not trying to give out too many eights perhaps im being a little loose with my eights today got to tighten up the eights what have we got here vegetable pad ti one of the more difficult dishes to make yourself at home because you need you know wild stuff like shrimp paste and tamarind paste all them kinds of pastes and uh so so to be able to uh make in the convenience comfort and convenience of your house smells real good it looks a hell of a lot like pad tie great sign try to get a little bit of everything here super hot i wish there other peanuts in it theres got to be peanuts cashews oh man they used cashews instead of peanuts i dont know if thats like an attempt to get around peanut allergies or if thats a also a tradition thing but usually when i get pad tie theres peanuts on it so this will be interesting theres definitely tartness so they must add citric acid or something cuz i didnt see lime juice really it it feels the way it looks its very gloppy in the mouth and the flavor is like pad ti flavor that played a few games of telephone you know its like yeah but also yeah its its i i cannot even point to whats off about it but theres something off maybe its the cashews instead of peanuts maybe im missing that there might be too much citric acid like it is quite tart god the bean sprouts instead of being like crisp and and and vegetable theyre mushy its not very good its its uh its not terribly bad it hasnt too much weird stuff going for it it it looks sloppy it eats sloppy tastes sloppy im going to give it a im going to give it a four its not quite good enough to get a five we have the green chili chicken bowl shredded dark meat chicken with cilantro and seasoned rice cheddar cheese and green chili sauce this sounds an awful lot like a dish that i uh tried to design with a frozen food company when i briefly uh entertained the notion of having a a babbish line of frozen dinners but they were gross so i so we didnt do it youre welcome the dark mate chicken looks really very finely shredded damn near to with a consistency of a paste and holy does that rice have a lot of cilantro on it wow nicos cooking down there nico is doing real cooking that sounds like a grease fire happening oh i barely taste cilantro in spite of seeing piles of it this whole bowl every aspect of it the rice the chicken the chilies the cheese all have the consistency of mush this is mush this is dog food with water added to it you know makes its own gravy thats whats happening here this has an abhorent texture the flavors fine tastes like taco spice pretty much um i sort of taste the chilies but they taste kind of canned they have that t canned tiny acidity to them the chicken is just mush it is just slop and the rice is super soft and mushy uh and the cheese is barely there and its kind of grainy its its pretty its pretty its pretty its its quite bad im going to give this a three i would eat it under duress and thats about it okay so next up what what do we have here its mandarin style orange chicken bowl now i have heard tall tal about this being pretty good its funny that they call it mandarin orange chicken because orange chicken is an is is is is an american invention uh i mean granted by a chinese american person but still invented in america for panda express so why does it say mandarin style orange chicken am i misinformed im misinformed i have to imagine that trader joes did their research before putting that on a box with tender battered dark chicken meat why they say dark chicken meat why isnt it dark meat chicken im keeping my eye on that im going to keep my eye on that so i have heard that this is i i think this is one of the more popular items from the trader joes freezer aisle i cannot imagine this being good like like tempura fried chicken frozen and reheated in microwave i cant imagine this and its called dark chicken meat let me keep my eye on that yeah not even a suggestion of crispness to it it is extremely mushy and i would say mostly breading i mean you know thats kind of the status quo here ill get a big piece just to lets do a little surgery here it looks like a fair amount of chicken inside of the breading so maybe i just got a really bready bite lets try this one thats a meteor bite however you know what this tastes exactly like leftovers leftovers reheated in the microwave so why not order chinese takeout keep the leftovers and eat those like youre already doing all right so i mean its relatively cheap but like damn yeah not super crazy let me try the uh broccoli just so i have a full picture i didnt even try the rice and broccoli and stuff the rice texture is like that um you know that bag of carolina rice that you get for cents and you boil it on the stove top and its got that very distinct taste and texture to it and thats what this tastes like it has that flavor it has that texture and its effectively been been cooked frozen reheated so its not even as light and fluffy as that would be to be fair i have had take out that is worse than this like i have had freshly made you know general se or sesame chicken that that has less chicken in it its more breading its chewier ander and this is better than that so thats thats an accomplishment i cant really hold it against it that its not crispy because it is frozen and theres a lot of it too like there a gen generous portion of of chicken in there im going to give it a im im going to give it a five like theres a lot of things about it that i dont like but theres nothing about it that makes me hate it i just want to say that nico is smashing it down there hes cooking and im not exaggerating four or five things at once hes got two burners going hes got in the oven hes got in the microwave and to think i said hed never amount to anything im sorry i never said i would never say that anywh who what do we have here we have beef bgi thinly sliced marinated beef in a sweet and savory sauce no story this did not this does not come with the rice full disclosure nico made this rice just so we could have something hes hes hes hes a hes a wonderin beef bogi its not bad it doesnt taste quite like bulgogi it just sort of tastes like generic asian sauce like heres some soy sauce and what do they put in here soy sauce oh they put par puree in here thats legit apple puree pineapple juice garlic cornstarch it has all the the pieces in there but somethings missing i dont know what it is the only thing thats reading bulgogi to me is the beef itself which is very good its got a good texture nice and fatty was perfect i never would have guessed that it was frozen um he sauteed this so this was not microwaved it was prepared in a saut pan so thats probably doing stuff for it its got little crispy bits and saucy heyd and um its uh its really quite good im conflicted because the flavor is like whatever the texture and the flavor of the beef is great the sauce is where its sort of coming undone i dont want to give out more eights we have enough eights but i think thats what it deserves if it had a perfect sauce you know wed be looking at a nine or a but this is an eight next up we have spicy thai shrimp fried rice smells fantastic and this was prepared in a saut pan so uh its going to hopefully have more of the fried rice kind of vibe to it oh yeah if these shrimp are good were in trouble oh w really bouncy but theyve been cooked frozen and reheated how much can i possibly expect from them the uh flavor is fantastic it is laden with i think lemongrass is it lemongrass its not a lemongrass but it is uh leaves which is apparently a very offensive name so just go ahead and bleep that um but thats what it says right here trader joes caught you found you right there in the ingredients what le leaves not on my watch so its its just its nice and spicy too its so flavorful its colorful the texture is not bad at all oh thats great im inclined to give it im inclined to give it a nine if the only reason that it that its that its getting a nine is cuz i dont want to give out another eight thats not fair thats not a democracy the shrimp are just not very good but the rest of it is so good its the best tasting thing ive had to nine im going to give it a nine the shrimp are as good as frozen shrimp can be and the rest is spectacular so im going to give this a nine love the flavor of this we got kungpow tempura cauliflower if im not mistaken this is one of the more popular joints now how you reheat this in the microwave you bake the cauliflower and then you combine it with the sauce oh so hopefully theres a little bit of crispy action going on here the sauce smells really vinegar ford thats cold lets try a different one oh my quote george te um thats really good well it looks like hell lets be honest this doesnt look very good but it is actually crispy crunchy um presentably from the baking and the flavor is really solid it still t tastes like the distinctly of cauliflower but the kungpow sauce wouldnt call that kungpow doesnt kungpow have peanuts in it as well where are the peanuts whatever it is tastes nice and good oh god im tempted to no the no the cauliflower is a little mushy but the the tempura crunch is better than i could have imagined it would be it is a little spicy but it looks like i think that i think that gets you an eight it really doesnt look great but it tastes is bus oh no no story damn it what a the stories go vegan thai green curry with tofu sheets vegetables and jasmine rice oh here we go an absolutely authentic i like that is it a product of thailand because then that shuts my mouth right up product of thailand if its a product of theyre saying it they dont say an authentic they say an absolutely authentic tha green curry made with tofu sheets ready to microwave with a side of jasmine rice period absolutely authentic i believe him they held me against the wall but by my throat i said this absolutely authentic my my toes were in off the ground its like darth vader it looks absolutely authentic i think the the proper way to do this is not to try things separately i should probably just just do actually can i can i um whats the name of those yogurts with the cup on top where you where you thats the brand but like what whats you know its got like a little cup of honey and you and you fold it and dump it i need to know please tell me this makes the cut cuz of what im about to do im about to f total split thiser and just kind of its clearly not designed to do that so well just go ahead and wouldnt have happened with fire total splits tell you that much so thats already not doing you know oh thats good spice level great flavors uh i mean pretty hard to screw this up but that doesnt cost you points just cuz its easy do yeah you could have told me that was tofu that was just freshly skinned you could have told me that tofu was still screaming from having been skinned the rice has a great texture it is very no that was the one where it didnt it wouldnt show me it is veryy whatever that tie word was for al dente nice and toothsome having a hard time finding anything wrong with it the rice does get a little mushy towards the center its chewier toward towards the outsides its not like this is restaurant quality then again if you serve this if i had this at a thai restaurant i would never guess that it was frozen id be like this is green curry this is what i ordered why you asking me just the right amount of spice level im going to give it a i love it well how about that beef bira slow cooked beef in a savory tomato and chili sauce this looks a lot like real beia uh if you took some tortillas and dip them in the fat and then fried them youd have yourself youd have youd have yourself a beus situation lets see the beef looks like normal is stew beef lets see if this tastes like the real deal it sort of kind of does and i dont know i could be very wrong about this but im im inclined to think that this is like oxtail because or maybe its i dont know beef rib thin little beef ribs or something the amount of connective tissue on it and its shape its like round little nubbins and its got its got a ton of like um uh connective tissue on it and that that that rings oxtail to me which is pretty dope ever so slightly spicy not very but like the flavor tastes like bira the slightest bit basic but like this is very solid bira like like i i im not an expert on the subject nor should you even believe anything i say ever but this to me tastes like solid beeran im inclined to give it a nine i can find very little wrong with it okay now we have the barbecue teriyaki chicken uh which is just a whole freaking lot of barbecue teriyaki chicken look at the sheer amount of it again this does not come with white rice nico furnish that out of the goodness of his heart smells like that stuff that comes out of a bottle that you put on really shy chicken to try and save it but it just makes it worse thats not bad no okay nop never mind never mind oh i know kendrick lamar said turn this tv off but im put the put these chopsticks down that should be the name of the song i dont want to hold the bag up doesnt deserve that no you should see this you you should see this you need to see the sauce is bad enough but the chicken has a terrible metallic off flavor to it that this happens a lot with frozen chicken and ive had frozen chicken today that does not have that flavor the reason for this is probably because trader joes is a private label company they work directly with manufacturers to create all the trader joes line of products and often theyre sourcing from entirely different people entirely different countries entirely different everything so this presumably is not prepared harvested or or or anything the same way as the other chicken that ive had today so youre going to have varying results with a private label company so far most of the stuff has been great today this has got to be the worst im giving this just cuz the chickens not like dry its got a good texture and the sauce tastes better than i thought the chicken itself is so have one more just make sure i didnt have a bad piece or something no there it is it hits late it comes late but it comes its coming for you unless you dont buy it so dont because its a two two okay kimbop i like kimbop sure it looks like it kims but will it bop korean tofu and vegetable seaweed rice roll straight up microwaved okay lets see what the doctor has to say about this im the doctor last time thats very hot oh its good the worst thing about it is the seaweed really its its really chewy this is to be expected i mean the youre hardly going to be able to get a great result also dont i dont like how its like its tightened like a like a like a like a belt around the rolls and its

have i dont know why im not doing it its cuz i dont want to eat another one im starting to get very full it is a pale limitation of fresh kimbop but the fact that this was frozen is very impressive the sushi rice uh is has a solid texture to it um the seaweeds regrettable the filling is good its it this is this is an achievement a

iDxTqo5F600,which country has the best breakfast,im a believer that breakfast is one of the greatest meals of all time and thats why today im on a mission to find the best breakfast in the world viewers from all over the globe submitted their favorite breakfast from their representative countries and thousands of votes later the results are in and were left with a top that come together to meet today in one insane battle the top four most popular dishes will ever earned to buy while the remaining eight will compete for their chance to move on through the tournament the worlds most beloved breakfasts are going to battle and we will find our champion starting with our first matchup ireland versus the philippines philippines with longsilog is garlic fried rice topped beautifully with a generous amount of fried garlic longanisa fried egg our favorite filipino chef christian said to serve with sliced tomatoes seasoned with fish sauce and the commenters in our filipino versus american breakfast called for achara pickled papaya and separately a dipping sauce made with cane vinegar and soy sauce you know to cut the richness of all that garlicky fried rice and pork next up ireland with the full irish breakfast youve been asking for this for a long time its very simple black and white pudding bangers rashers baked beans fried eggs fried tomato box tea and mushrooms and we even got soda bread served on the side with marmalade and butter we aint around brother our guest taste tester today is david douglas he is an austin legend known for trying all of the greatest restaurants and telling people all about it on instagram and of course quince vicam director and season channel taste tester two unlikely competitors the philippines versus ireland honestly these are really strong contenders i dont even know where to begin i want to go philippines i cant even say anything i want to just keep eating it that rice is incredible longan is incredible its just a great combination of things im busting that makes two bust the rice unbelievably garlicky but not overwhelmingly so its almost more of a fragrance than it is like some sort of blast in your face long anise is fantastic its sweet its salty its umami fried egg only makes a beautiful sauce with crispness all the acutron its wonderful theres so many different flavors and textures and they all go so well together and individually each bite is incredible no matter which component you taste theres nothing to not enjoy its great when flavor town was founded this is what they had in mind they wanted that garlic they wanted the sausage they wanted these town members coming together to form a sort of a town maybe a town of flavor you could call it okay i i i rend i dont even know where to begin with this i know where im beginning soda me bread thats what im thinking too for me this one has the variety going for it its kind of a playground for you to dip dive dunk i cant stop eating i keep eating something then i go back for something else its all great flavors all combined into one amazing plate that i thought would be a bit too much i thought theres too many different components but all of them work really well together even the filipino one same thing its hard im hard what um this is really hard its voting time two three unanimous wow ireland im really sorry its so tasty the unanimous vote it doesnt represent how close these were for me but i think we all put the slight edge to the philippines moving on the philippines moves on powerfully to the next round to face mexico but first we head to our next round one matchup france versus colombia colombia with arapa conos ive never had this before and i got to say these are two things that i love so i have a feeling this is a strong contender two pan of saut tomato and green onion add eggs seasoned taste with salt and stir until soft scrambled served with a hand formed fried white corn arapa crispy on the outside but tender chewy almost voluptuous on the inside and enjoy france with the corant i mean we know what this is right butter and dough rolled into multiple layers and once cut and baked crisp be airy pastries that make me want to take my socks off and wiggle my little piggies i think we should start with france cuz its the simplest you can dip them into a cappuccino if you want or eat them by themselves this is a good croissant the butter is buttering nice crispy airy all the qualities of good croissant and i think a good breakfast as well so crispy part of me does want to americanize the croissant and stuff it with other things the french would be appalled well actually the french are finally evolving a little bit you know took them a while but theyre on their way god bless them every laugh i get out of josh he pays me another five nickels ive got a whole dollar now lets move on to the colombian dish i like this if you are not from columbia but youre used to like maybe an egg andor bacon centric breakfast it feels new youre so used to maybe like toast or hash browns with your eggs this is a great change of pace if youve never had this before i love this i also love that the eggs are deeply flavorful and theyve got some vegetative quality to them its nice the eggs are great everything thats combined into the eggs really elevates it past to very basic scrambled eggs the egg and the pepper mixture its really working for me in way ways that other dishes havent so far its voting time what the eggs are great but you know its just eggs when youre on the streets of france youre walking down and its like in the morning you just smell those buttery croissants that hits like nothing else thats why it just takes a slight edge i have a retort just eggs is ignoring the tomatoes the peppers spices and the so that went into this delicious colombian meal and thats why frankly i disagree with you im in between the two opinions here the croissant is so unique to france and theres nothing else like it so i almost wanted to vote for this but just personally i enjoyed this one more that means columbia moves on to the next round onto our next match up vietnam versus turkey vietnam coming with fa vietnam recently did very well in our other video where we were looking for which country has the best sandwich now look although f is popular in the united states its much lesser known as a breakfast item but were told by a few vietnamese chef friends that in vietnam its a way of life lay thinly sliced raw beef on top of your cooked rice noodles pour over boiling hot broth to the beef garnish with thai basil sliced onion green onion little thai chili cilantro bra sliced beef and finally bean sprouts serve and enjoy turkey coming in with menamin we followed this recipe exactly from a youtube channel turkish food travel thank you for that you start by sauting peppers and butter and olive oil followed with chopped tomato season with salt to break that down cook it down roughly crushed using your potato masher then gently stir in some scrambled eggs and very gently cook till the eggs are just barely set you dont want to overcook this add a little cheese on top optionally serve that with bread and its that simple what should we try for first this ones giving a lot more breakfast energy for me so im going to get in here first thats insane it got really cold outside and this feels like such a nice warming presence this is a great breakfast to start off the day on any day i didnt know how the bread was going to go with it but that soft texture on top of another soft texture wasnt a problem it was just a really good taste whatever that light green spicy pepper in there its like the perfect amount of heat and also the flavor is a little bit more subtle than a jalapeno you got cooked down concus tomato essentially red ball pepper for a little bit of sweetness and then you have this green pepper that provides an herbaceousness a little bit more of a vegetable flavor but then theres the egg its custardy its juicy its cheesy i mean its kind of like everything that you like about many breakfasts in the world in one but its funny you bring up needing to warm up because we have a bowl of warm fa which i would argue is maybe the perfect item for the winter this is light refreshing i can feel good about going along the day if i had this for breakfast but the menen is a flavor punch i dont know that i would say this is less flavorful less spicy its definitely less spicy but i think f is all about flavor theyre both good in in their own right what do you think david never came here to taste anything he came here to eat time to vote wow unanimous im not saying that this dish is better than this im just saying that this is a better breakfast dish than this i wish i grew up in vietnam eating fu for breakfast every day and associated that with breakfast but unfortunately i didnt and so this eggy peppery bready dish just gave more breakfast energy to me i i couldnt help it i fully agree turkey moves on to the next round onto our final round one match up brazil versus australia two places i love but who is going to make it to the quarterfinals brazil with pow deo aka cheese bread i could eat a thousand of these im not going to lie you need an oiled hand to get your dough balls separated placed onto a baking sheet baked at fhe until they come out rich golden and beautiful serve immediately with strawberry jam and black coffee australia with avocado toast in our recent fast food breakfast video our friend andy cooks said that australia loves and is known for its breakfast so andys here to describe the australian avoc toast it has to be avocado on toasted sos and a poach dig on top soft goat cheese and a nut seed topping called duer seasoned with salt and seasoned with lemon zist garnished with micro coriander and served with cold smoked salmon on the side back to you legend andy we love you and by we i mean me its funny because this is clearly from brazil but to me when i think of avocado toast i think of california so lets try one the powder cjo i thought this was going to be heavier coming into this but its really light its airy i feel like i could eat three of them maybe four and this jam that goes with it is a great pairing im not a fan of the coffee im not a fan of any coffee but thats besides the point this is great cheese bread and coffee in my head im like ah its nice by far the best part for me is the texture its like got almost like a mochi sort of situation where youre like chewing it a little longer you think but youre enjoying every moment of it the jam the coffee sweet not sweet works just like the boys were saying i also like the saltiness that the cheese adds to the bread a lot of breads to me are often times und salted this is perfectly salted this actually one of my favorite breads of all time this going to be a tough battle that said avocado toast i will say avocado toast is one of my favorite foods on earth but having it next to the pwed cjo i dont know its tough its light and refreshing as well its in a different way i would not be upset starting my morning with something like that its a good texture its a good flavor you know what avocado toast is its exactly what you expect thats the challenge for me its like theres no novelty factor here im trying to put my brain into objective mode but its just saying ive had that before i havent had cheesy bread and jam before thats a new thing i want to latch on to that now we vote one two and three oh the odd man listen avocado toast is great and most times i would want it for breakfast one of my problems with it is its kind of just is what it is you get bored of it really quick what i liked about the powder cjo is on its own its delicious delicious with jam but think of all the other things you can do with this this is such a great base you know i dont know if i could say the same thing about this its fighting against something that has like how many components on it this is one the flavors are theyre not similar but id say theyre on like a similar level for me but the texture of the pow dejo is just so much higher for me its more interesting its something im going to be thinking about later today and you know after youat a couple of them i feel like youre pretty full i feel like i kind of have to work my way through the avocado toast nothing wrong with it i just prefer the brazil one a bit more moving on sorry to australia and our man andy but brazil deservedly takes the final spot in the quarter final matchups our first matchup of this round is a battle between two heavyweights mexico versus the philippines mexico with chile kiles this is our top vote getter today we have my rojo recipe which features guo ancho and sorrano chilies the recipes in the in the description along with an even easier variation using a can of chipot lace we sent this recipe to chef alejandra at estee one of the top mexican restaurants here in austin and she gave her stamp of approval she did mention that she tossed the chips and sauce together in a separate bowl being careful not to oversaturate the chips to prevent sogginess great tip i dont know what to do here because if someone were like josh whats your favorite breakfast it would be one of these two things youre in a tough position i on the other hand just want to eat food and im going to worry about the rest later thats crazy how good that is i would like to be baptized in this salsa i went on vacation recently and for days i was out i had chile killes every single morning for breakfast unapologetically it is incredible well get into this i dont know theyre so different i feel sorry for us having to make this decision but i feel sorry for everyone that cant experience what were eating right now cuz this is incredible i dont know what the to do here i think we got to stop thinking and start writing all right guys wow this is not an easy decision i thought it would be going into this i thought it would blow it out of the water but honestly i couldnt stop eating that garlic fried rice i couldnt stop eating the longa even though the chil heil is i feel like flavorwise was a little higher but this is just such a good balanced breakfast for me it came down to one factor only these right here i couldnt stop eating these if this was on that whole different story despite the chili killes being very good couldnt top that for me the way i looked at it was if i was at a restaurant and i saw both of these on the menu i would pick this over this every time chili kace is everywhere but how often do you see a great filipino breakfast somewhere so philippines moves on to the next round our next matchup is the th seated columbia versus our fourth seated india india with masala dosa breakfast varies widely depending on where you are in india but most votes from you went to the masala dosa filled with spiced potato and onion mixture served with a coconut chutney and sambar a spiced lentil stew from south india really tasty wow i grew up with this masaladosa is such a classic it has so many good flavors and different options you can choose from while still just being a light vehicle to eat its really balanced theres a lot of good flavors but its not too heavy you can eat that whole thing for breakfast and feel good about it the rest of the day its fragrant got a little crunch its got a little chew you have the creaminess of the mashed potato its a little spicy its a little sweet the auton on the side just an extra layer of flavor a little bit of hydration to it even though it doesnt need it not dry at all really good and then when you do the dunk now half of the crunchy isnt so crunchy anymore its a lot going on and it all works together but its going up against a heavy hitter will it be enough to overtake columbia this is a tough pick but its time unanimous although the araba com w us are delicious this is just super unique theres nothing in the world like this i could eat this every morning i can eat it every morning i could also eat it for lunch and dinner its just something that keeps you entertained the whole time youre doing i agree ive done that and its fantastic you can mix and match whats inside you can mix and match the acont its a great dish india moves on to the semifinals against the philippines now to our next quarterfinal matchup usa versus turkey usa the full american breakfast this needs no explanation big fluffy pancakes to with butter maple syrup a plate of bacon hash brown and scrambled eggs its a timeless staple but is it really going to be able to stack up against our contenders today i love seeing these two dishes in front of each other cuz theyre so incredibly different funny enough the american one looks a little anemic just because theres such a lack of color i like that theres like red and green and peppers and this nice rustic bread beautifully in a bowl is kind of telling a cultural differences should we start with this one yeah jesus david you can eat as much as you want after this were making a sandwich m i will say theres no combination on earth thats more more iconic in the breakfast world than bacon maple syrup fresh pancakes whats more iconic than that back to the menen just to refresh my memory here all right its so tough cuz these are classic flavors but compared to all the flavors weve had today all these new diverse flavors that im experiencing it doesnt hit the same i think im getting hit in the head with sweetness and fat which i do love but when you introduce other flavors then suddenly those kind of turn from a bright light to a kind of a gray dullness you know ready two three unanimous again i love both dishes but the sweetness and the fat it just didnt compare to the araceous the spice of the turkish dish yeah this warmed my soul but this danced on my tongue one more thing look how fast this comes together if you want to make this you need to cook bacon you need to cook hash browns you need to cook scrambled eggs and you need to cook pancakes all in separate pans by the way this is kind of a high effort all that to lose to a one pan wonder and the one pan wonder moves on a big upset turkey continues its journey towards the crown with a triumphant win over usa onon the quarterfinal matchup brazils versus england number two england with the full english fry up weve seen this video before all right i have a whole recipe for this and it is that exact recipe except we did include black pudding and bubble and squeak we wanted to keep it og onto a large plate spoon of generous portion of hines beans separating the rest of the plate with a sausage wall lay down your eggs mushrooms english bacon black pudding bubble and squeak fried bread finish with brua tomatoes and some fresh cracked black pepper the full english breakfast im trying to get everything in one bite thats my strategy here is build up sort of a tower of babble sort of situation now that guys i will admit quite delicious getting all the flavors together it really gives you an appreciation for all the small individual kingdoms of england that came together to make this beautiful dish probably a lot of people died oh certainly i think thats mostly what im tasting here he had the experience of putting everything together and having a great time i had a great time having everything separate and its just as good theres a lot of components on here i didnt really touch the beans but everything else on here is really good individually and i keep coming back i think that says a lot about this dish im one of the most indecisive eaters youll ever meet anytime i go to restaurant i will order almost everything off of the menu that may seem gluttonous but the funny thing is its not so much about volume of eating its more so volume of choices and what i love about an english breakfast is it has many textures and flavors and proteins and carbs and starches and crispy and chewy and fatty and juicy and so on and so forth if im going out to breakfast and i order this i dont need to order anything else i live in fear that my tower of english breakfast will be the best thing ive had today and nothing else will be able to compare but thats something im just going to have to live with unless we find something better could be brazil one two three unanimous i mean its not really a fair competition the pow cjo originally up against the avocado toast was the simple one over the complicated but in this case the complicated one because of the variety of choice and it was all delicious im so happy with this i feel like i could eat this every day it goes to show you just when you think youve got it figured out you dont true on to the next and england takes our final spot in the semifinals now its getting serious with only two more matchups until our final round starting here with the philippines versus india we are now in the semifinals with two incredibly beautiful unique breakfasts totally different from any american breakfast i think we just need to refresh oursel here its going to be so hard to beat that india this is a crazy matchup theyre both flavor powerhouses i really thought this would be a matter of which one do i want to keep eating but unfortunately both of them i want to keep eating its also tough to compare cuz theyre really so different this one has more sweetness more fragrance this one has all the spices and aromatics and they both have a ton of textures too theyre so different and one and the same at the same time all right i have my answer whoever wins this could win the whole thing one two waa india it was a great journey and i really feel like it had a chance to win the whole thing but for now we move on to our semifinal round england versus turkey england you have a lot of opportunity to win here because youve got eight plus elements the minimon has two the dish and the bread lets begin back to the menan this is tough i feel like the texture bar is a lot higher on the english breakfast but the flavor bar is a bit higher on the turkey breakfast i feel like the flavor on the english breakfast it has a ceiling but there is a lot to love about the english breakfast im definitely feeling the fact that were getting into the finals rounds here and this is becoming a lot more difficult just remember whatever you choose dont worry youre probably going to disappoint a whole culture if you have an immigrant parent youre used to that three oh i thought it was going to be another clean sweep for turkey the only reason i chose the england one was simply because there are more combinations on this plate and youre going to scoop this bread in there or times until youre done at some point its just going to be the same thing over and over and over that will not happen with this and heres the kicker this was the thing that really sold me the brua tomatoes provide the same effect that this does if you take these tomatoes the eggs mix them together and put it on toast now im not saying the flavors are the same but just texturally a little bit of tomatoey sweetness some egg you can get almost there i think i see what youre saying for me this is like an amusement park im dipping im diving im combining things in different ways which is great but for this im just going on the same roller coaster again and again but its the one that goes the fastest goes the highest comes crashing down with the peppers and it turns out im an adrenaline junkie when it comes to breakfast as i said before theres i think a bar to where the flavor can go on this one at a certain point it hits a limit and this one it just keeps going it keeps building and i dont get bored of it granted its like one of the first times ive had it but i think im going to want it again over and over and over this has now become one of my favorite breakfast dish its a sleeper and i think it deserves its top spot and there it is turkey medaman battled its way all through and takes its rightful place in the final match up against the philippines we have two underdogs these were some of the least voted for dishes and yet both of them made it to the finals im going to get in here first i give some an examination to that now the mena men all right i have my answer you guys take as long as you need roos trying to hit his minimum caloric requirement today as soon as possible oh my god this does not help you make a decision whatsoever does it now that ive gone into the depths of my piggy nature i know what i need to do oh my god the wind goes to the philippines for the best breakfast so many different cultures so many different ingredients philippines got a deserved wind it climbed all the way from the bottom all the way to the top just like turkey did which was a very very close second i feasted on both of these meals and only one dish had pork and it was sweet pork with garlic rice with pickles and all those sensations despite how good the dish from turkey was despite me loving every minute of eating it i had to give it to the philippines theres a winner here but i think the real winners are us both of these are fantastic dishes every dish we had was incredible really hard decision to make but at the end i just had to give philippines that slight edge because the flavor the texture combination was just that much higher but im not disappointed at all in our second place choice there are many other

aopS3q6f1GY,cooking tips for kitchen beginners epicurious,im frank proto im a professional chef and color instructor and today im going to show you my best cooking tips for beginners well be going over things to keep in mind before during and after you turn on that stove this is cooking tips while we talk about my tips im going to prepare a carbonara lets get started with the tips the most important tip i have is before you do anything read the recipe with this simple tip a lot of mistakes can be prevented and avoided so many times in my life people have read the recipe quote unquote they start cooking and they miss something save your pasta water theyve thrown their pasta water out all right give me a few minutes so i can read my recipe excuse me most recipes are written the same exact way a title with the amount of servings a list of ingredients and then a list of instructions usually in a recipe the first ingredient is the first thing youll use in the instructions the second ingredient is the second thing youll use in instructions if a recipe is written well the ingredients go along with the instructions read through it all and then start your recipe so after you read your recipe the next thing you want to do is do your miseen plus chef frank what is miseen plus mise and plus means everything in its place its a french term gather your ingredients get them together before you start cooking that doesnt just mean your food that means your equipment and everything you need to execute this recipe so on the tray next thing i have my mason plus you can see that i have my equipment around me as well everythings within arms reach so i dont have to run around the kitchen like my hair is on fire first thing im going to do is grate my cheese im going to put all this on the side and if there is an instruction that you need to grate your cheese make sure thats part of your amazing place im going to grate a fair amount of cheese for my carbonara carbonara is basically bacon eggs and cheese so we grate a bunch right theres my pecorino romano im going to do my parmigiano i like to use a box crater on its side like this im not doing it granny styles i like to use my body weight because its considerable i always crack on a flat surface oh look at how beautiful that egg is eggs are cracked im just going to give them a quick whisk next thing i want to do is cut our guanchali guanciale is a cured pork chow and that brings me to my next tip is have sharp knives shes a common misconception that sharp knives are dangerous when the fact is that dull knives are even more dangerous than sharp knives you have to put more pressure on the knife and you have a bigger tendency to slip and cut yourself if your knife isnt sharp you can learn about sharpening your knives we did a video on this channel try and find a knife that is comfortable in your hand it should be super sharp so you dont really have to put a lot of pressure you see if i do a little sawing here its a nice smooth cut i am not having to struggle with this just whispers through if it isnt sharp sometimes youll do a lot of sawing you can ruin your ingredients because youre crushing them or tearing them so having a sharp knife saves you time saves you ingredients and saves your fingers from getting cut now that i have all my miseen plus ready to go we can cook so my next tip is keep an open mind were using guanchali it sounds weird maybe it looks a little weird and its strange to you by the end of the day its really just a type of bacon push yourself stretch yourself try new things youd be surprised on how many times theyre actually really delicious so i got a little oil in my pan guanciale goes in and what were going to do with this is were going to cook it lightly brown but not crisp one of the other tips i give people is be present be in the moment and use all of your senses a lot of times youre going to smell things that are burning before they actually burn and you might be able to catch it and save it a lot of times when youre listening you can hear something is way too high because its really too loud and it shouldnt be that loud but listen to whats going on taste whats going on smell whats going on so not only can i hear the guanciale sizzling away i can see that its browning im going to shut it off here and wait until were ready to use it another tip for beginner cooks is comfort right we want to be comfortable when were cooking thats one thing we really dont talk about a lot is comfort i like to stand straight up i like for my shoulders to be loose i try not to tighten up too much if youve been hunching over the stove for hours and your feet hurt because your shoes are uncomfortable or youre wearing that tight turtleneck in the kitchen at the end of the day we want cooking to be enjoyable and fun and if youre not comfortable its just going to make it a less enjoyable experience one of the other tips id like to talk about is buy the best ingredients you can afford buy the best cheese you can afford the best pork the best pasta the best eggs and the end product is always going to be better good ingredients equals good food so for the carbonara i have my eggs beaten im going to beat in some cheese good quality eggs always have really bright orange yolks and these eggs are wonderful and basically what im going to do with this is make kind of a paste out of my cheese and eggs im going to hit it with some salt and lots of black pepper again good quality black pepper is always ground to order right so grind your own pepper there is a point in almost every recipe where everything collides at once its the time when action is required if youre prepared you have your mise en place youve read your recipe when this point comes youre not going to freak out youre going to be chill everythings going to come together beautifully okay lets use our senses and see where our pasta is at i can see that my pasta is a little floppy right and now i can taste my pasta is perfect al dente shut my water off and i am going to use my tongs and if ive read my recipe right i need to save some of that pasta water right so instead of putting it down the drain with our colander were going to save that pasta water its got salt and starch thats going to help our finished dish be delish liming again look at that im not too worried about draining this pasta off too well all right and then here is where everything comes together its the moment of truth the moment that you need the most confidence youve had all day adding the eggs this could be the time where everything goes wrong or everything goes right which leads me to my next tip cook with confidence youve prepared for this moment youre ready so what im going to do now is im actually going to shut my heat off im going to add my egg and cheese mixture im going to add a nice ladle of my pasta water and im gonna toss so we talk about cooking with confidence give it a flip if you can make sure it goes all over it splashes the dog but we want to stir with confidence so the worst thing that can happen is that you dont eat this tonight you order a pizza you order some chinese food thats the worst that can happen music carbonara is ready to go and that leads me to my next tip master the recipe or at least be confident with your skills enough that you can start modifying if you havent mastered the recipe take your time get it down and then you can start to modify things to your preference if you start modifying things too early and dont master the recipe or the technique things arent going to come out good take your time be patient with yourself know your skill level once you have that down youre going to be a better cook and you can make carbon art too the last tip i have keep cooking youre not going to get better at this unless you cook all the time cook with friends cook with family enjoy the meal you cook with the people you love the more you cook the better youll get dont get discouraged from failure have fun enjoy what youre doing food and cooking should be an enjoyable endeavor and those are my cooking tips for beginners i hope this helps good luck on your cooking journey enjoy music bon appetito music
bpjnIqyW2cA,nigella lawson rainy day cooking and party feasts nigella bites season full series tonic,music the way i cook is very influenced by the way my mother cooked before me indeed most of what i feel about food comes from my family but i think this makes sense for all of us because food can never be just fuel it really is almost personal history and there are certain dishes which i remember from my childhood which i want my children in turn to remember eating and be able to cook look we just show you how to cut out these for the thing i music know um can i put put this on the top okay okay you me just open it right down thank you thats it o love look so what you can do now my darling is carry this away look this isnt a recipe really i mean its just something i remember my mother making for us at home i mean nothing thats been you know written down or passed down from generations but we ate it she cooked it and you know thats what i love about it its not you know precise charts and nuclear physics no but what this is is something absolutely perfect its just soft boiled eggs with instead of toast soldiers asparagus beers which once you lop off this and i dont think this is a moment when tapping would be appropriate you just sold a bit and dip in the asparagus bear been cooked for about minutes egg for about four and its delicious and although of course you know soft b eggs are slightly nursery is any way you can use this in kind a grown up way if you want like a starter for dinner party i think it makes asparagus go further i think its rather wonderful way of eating it and what you can do is get wonderful sort of cats tongue pink plates of palah ham you can just wrap the spears like you know napkins edible napkins h so good this is one of my paternal grandmothers cooker notebooks which i love its full of things that shes just cut out of newspapers or her friends center and the actual hardback book costs i see and she got it um some of the recipes i have no desire to do i mean i dont really want to do aspic cream and some i do want i mean like this lunch dish which i like cooking um a nice thing here chaua of chicken shes written by hand afterwards excellent and um this is one of my maternal grandmothers cookery books this is a bit more modern id say sort of and i do remember helping her take notes and doing all that um again very much things like lemon mousse ker patte um which people dont do that much now um her gingerbread and butter pudding i still do cook i mean i love these cuz theyre a bit like you know photograph albums i mean theyre social history family history i like that this is mine and im afraid im not such a good note taker as either of my grandmothers so for example in this notebook i written down all the ingredients and what im doing but i havent put the title so here im trying to work out what on earth was i cooking but anyway so you know my children will get this they might not thank me for it but thats like continuing the family cooking sausages and leners are something my mother often cooked for us tea when we were children and now i cook for my children actually the way i do sausages and lentils is slightly different than the way my mother did in the sense that i use these italian sausages and p lentils or sometimes the ones from italy from umbria lovely ones wonderful sort of like blue green slate color let me just get some oil into this pan so what i need to do first just bruise a bit of garlic get the skin off now garlic has cooked just the right amount when you begin to feel or smell this aroma waffed up so now sausages in look at these all fat pearled and plump these ones are called genovesi in other words they come from genoa and what this means is they have basel and garlic and they are he with both onion on for the lentil and some salt which will stop it from browning cu these have to stay soft and somehow mel with the lentils very old w spoon i think actually it was my sister thomasa i actually have some here i think that were i this was my mothers i dare say if i dug around for long enough i could find one of my grandmothers and im going to do a bit of turning over oh lovely so theyre brown on all sides what i want is to have a kind of lovely rich sticky gravy to eat with this which is very very easy to arrange just a question of pouring in some wine rather wonderful alcoholic faal im getting here and then diluting it a bit with some water you could use cherry and water too i would wouldnt worry about it so lid on heat down lles you see how beautiful those pebbly lentil sort of oil slick bits of translucent onion all through right so now just give the lentils the same treatment as the sausages in other words cover with water generously the lentils will absorb the water as they cook heat down lid on and they should both cook in around minutes and that gives me time to do a little light clearing up and give myself a glass of wine music okay we should be about ready lift off so the waters been absorbed which is perfect m lovely and theyre cooked so its really just a matter of putting the sausages on top of the lles i like keeping the string on i think it looks so beautiful anyway might give you of extra work and then squish down that bruised garlic that went in into the sort of whiny juices and just turn up the heat to reduce it a bit cuz i want them to be really sort of rich and sticky i ill do some parsley while i wait perfect that looks about it so just pour m look those lovely juices over fling over the parsley and thats it i mean its not fancy cooking certainly but just proper home food just as i really value the cookbooks that ive got from my grandmothers so i really love other peoples family compilations there are a couple here which i particularly love stephanie alexanders recipes my mother gave me and mimi sherians from my mothers kitchen i mean the point about these sorts of books is they tell stories not just give recipes the recipes they do give are for me the most important ones thats to say home cooking the antithesis of restaurant food i mean heres a recipe for french toast and i love this because just because food isnt fashionable anymore doesnt mean we dont want to eat it and we all want to remember our family favorites i had completely forgotten about lip tower until quite recently i dont know why i remembered it but i did and then i had to try and evoke it from taste memory and help of a few books now what it is is really a kind of upmarket sandwich bread that was sort of very fashionable when i was a child and and before really it comes from middle europe somewhere and is incredibly good and very easy no cooking at all so that was some curd cheese now some cream cheese and first just blending them till this smooth before you know adding all my bits and pieces okay softened i mean this is so easy i mean its kind of ridiculous and really you can just do all these things to taste mean of course you can i mean all cooking is like that but this particularly so some french mustard caraway seed which i love look at these beautiful papers is a little crocodile skinned rounds paprika im using smoked paprika cuz i love it but i mean paprika that wonderful terra cotta color and some cornisha which does these little girkins i mean if you can only get big girkins just chop them up i mean im chopping these anyway i like quite a lot in here this spiky vinegar really you know helps punctuate the creaminess of the cheese in and just music mix thats it bit of a scrape done and then this is a tupperware which ive lined with cling film because the point is although you can just put this in a bowl and just you know dollop it out on a bit of toast or bagel the real retro experience has to produce it in a kind of molded hump so thats what im doing my own way to just smooth the top fold back these overhanging bits of ining film and then weigh it down with this tin once this has been in the fridge for a couple of hours it will have chilled and set and you can unmold it easily can i just tell you something until you have eaten lip tower on split unbuttered poppy seed bagels or toasted black bread you havent lived when i was a child white bait was the restaurant starter um you so rarely see it now that i feel i have to explain to some of you anyway what white bit even is and what it is is this little fish it really refers more to the size than to the genus but its sort of most commonly spratz or herring uh the original small fry in fact and its incredibly easy to cook them you just dust in flour and then deep fry whatever means you want get some ordinary pepper i think these were my sister thomasinas favorite food she always ordered them when we went to restaurants um so its kind of a memory of her that i cooked them and then you just really chuck them in a deep fat fryer you dont have to use something like this i mean you can just use a wide sauce sp or deep frying pan the other thing thats really traditional to eat with white bait is brown bread and butter and ideally the lemon wedges should be kind of cloaked in muslin and tied like little bon bonss these should be about ready now to come out me see if i rustle them oh wonderful papery noise and just tumble them out onto the kitchen towel not that anyone would have been bothered then about excess oil on their plate and now this is the most important accompaniment some parsley for deep frying you should use a splatter guard for this but im not going to im just going to stand back instead its the water in the parsley that helps we are deep fried parsley is wonderful its not that unlike that thing of you know seaweed in chinese restaurants which is just deep fried shredded cabbage so sprinkle it on the white bait some lemon and eat that crunch time for revival i music think there are a few things i like to keep in the ladder not that i use them a lot but really more for sentimental than colony reasons this camp coffee remember that i have a real fondness for the memory of it my mother used to make something called milk in a dash which was warm milk with a few drops of this in i mean i think probably is leftover from a long time ago i dont remember buying it recently and crystallized violets which my mother and my grandmother particularly used to like look at that wonderful not an everyday ingredient m now this i do like to use quite a bit ginger jam really evocative smell for me and it is the basis of my grandmothers delicious bread and butter pudding the other way my grandmothers bread and butter pudding is different is is that she used brown bread its s to be brown bread in place of white and what she did is make sandwiches with the bread and this ginger jam and then just squid them together which gives a lovely kind of juicy aromatic center to this pudding mean i know that bread and butter pudding had a revival in thes and probably now considered you know deeply unfashionable and boring what i always felt was a great pity is that it just became a kind of restaurant item and bread and butter pudding isnt restaurant food i mean its home food many through i reckon pieces of bread so five sandwiches al together although were going to cut them is about right for my pudding basin okay this is easy well its all easy i mean its that sort of cooking just cut these sandwiches into triangles and then just its pudding basins been greased with butter just put these sandwiches in when i what i do is what she did so the first one goes in with a triangle like this and then the next one with the triangle down this way and what this does is that you get nice pointy bits peeking out from the custard at the end and they get lovely brown and crispy and crunchy then again just because this is what she did i just put one along each side now these are sultanas and what ive done is ive just soaked these in ram and i found the easiest way to do this quickly so they come really plump and sort of aromatically filled with it with the liquor is just putting the microwave for a minute and just leave them to cool now the custard cuz all bread and butter pudding is is bread butter and baked in a custard soft set one this is very soft set because i like to use mostly yolks dont like too much white so i have have four yolks and one whole egg just you do need some white to set but if you use too much white i find it makes it too sort of firm a custard and i want it to be really sort of ousy tender okay sugar this is a lot to do with taste i think three these spoons is plenty after all the fruit is quite sweet and the ginger jam is sweet its got heat but its also got sweetness bit of gentle whisking and then some cream i have to say my grandmother who had more austere tastes and you know lived in a more austere age just used milk but i like to use about ms double cream and to full that milk to stir and then pour this gorgeous yellow cream over the bread and let it soak for about minutes because really you want it to soak in a bit before you bake it and then all you need to do then is just dab butter over the little pointy bits that stick out and then sprinkle over some demera sugar in a good crunch and some ground ginger for just aroma and then put it in the oven music m the smell of my music childhood when my paternal grandmother died i got given her cookery notebooks though i should say that i have no recollection of my grandmother cooking from them or indeed cooking she decided very early on that she got vertigo in the kitchen and therefore for health reasons you understand never actually cooked i do cook from them actually though and this is the lunch dish thats what its called that i do quite a lot and its really a free form pie filled with mint meat and like all pies you have to start with a pastry to make the pastry measure g of plain flour and cut g of hard vegetable fat like cooking or something like that and g of cold unsorted butter and really youre just mixing the butter and fat into the flour until what youve got is a kind of sandy porridge oats look so when youve got this look you pour in chilled water very very slowly until you have something which is about to c here thats to say you dont want a clump of dough you want something that looks like its shortly again to be a clump of dough and at this stage you can just tip the dough out of the processor out of the mixing bowl and just squidge it together with your hands until youve got a dough and then twist it into two form a sort of flat fat disc and put each disc into a plastic bag or wrapped with cing film and stick it in the fridge like all pastries it has to sit and rest in the fridge for at least minutes which gives you time to get on with the filling now i love this theres something very retro about it minced meat sort of jazzed up with hardboiled eggs black olives and tomatoes and a pinch of all spice and this must have seemed so sort of adventurous to the postwar housewife you pass me night as far as im concerned its not just eating together as a family that matters but also cooking together i mean i love cooking with my sister for the filling just get a large frying pan out and over medium heat warm some oil just a bit of olive oil orary olive oil vegetable if you want and just chop up a couple of small onions or one medium to large onion and soften the onion in the pan if you sprinkle a bit of salt on top of the onion it will stop the onion from coloring because it extracts water out of the onion and therefore it doesnt actually sizzle and fry once youve done that just tip in half a can of chopped tin tomatoes and stir around a bit now add g of minced beef and turn the beef round a few times so that it breaks up and browns on all sides well i would wait till its browned first to ste it all over when the meats brown although dont be fanatical about it just mostly brown and most of the pink gone just add a couple of hardboiled eggs roughly chopped but a handful of black olives roughly chopped as well how exotic and know color and interest and then give a good turn with a wooden spoon give a pinch of all spice bit of pepper might need some salt but the olives tend to be salty and then stir well and cook over gentle heat just about minutes at this stage you really are going to have to let the meat cool a bit because you dont want to put piping hot meat out onto pastry so roll out one of the discs into a rough square and then transfer your square onto a baking sheet and start rolling out the other square and then you can just tip the slightly cooled minc meat onto the first square and then dible a bit with your fingers into some cold water and just sprinkle it around the edges of the square this will just help the two bits stick together oh very nice okay so then plun your top bit of pastry on top and i like this bit that comes next cuz its um makes you feel competent in a very unjustifiable way which is though you start squidging the bits of pastry together and roll them up probably about three turns so that youve got a rough sort of humped border all around and then get a fork out and with the tin curved downwards just press further to help squid the border together its nice and gooey isnt it the pastry thanks a lot and then prong the top of the pastry to make air holes anywhere you want youre the one who went to white school and then brush with a bit of egg wash and egg wash is just a way of saying uh you know an egg with a bit of water and a te bit of salt beaten together and then bake in an oven moderate oven for about music minutes you clever did you like utensils i do i think thats a very good idea exent but not quite yet i have the truth is i love good food and lots of it at any time but i know too that at the end of a long day cooking can seem just like another exhausting chore so what we need is a sort of simple food you can face cooking on those days when you just have to hit that kitchen music running were doing the shoot for the book now were day seven its a day shoot weve done so far id say rolles of film pictures so were all feeling a bit frazzled which is why i have to come my hair for music week mozzarella and corota is the ultimate tv dinner its quick to make you eat it with your hands and the really useful thing is the few ingredients you do need you can just pop out in your lunch hour and buy milk now all you do is make s sandwiches with this very nice italian bread as you can see i mean im sure the italians dont use plastic bread but it works very well crusts off this makes great sort of quick tea for children when they come back from school cuz it doesnt take long to make and they love it its like i suppose pizza sandwich put some tomato in i suppose just going to put the oil in the pan now because these dont take long to make jackson poock with the oil here now you just use ordinary mozzarella you dont need to get that expensive buffalo mozzarella because if anything the point about this sandwich is you dont want it too milky and liquid and you want this to be melting and gooey but you dont want it actually to make the bread too damp inside okay slice this doesnt matter how you slice it cuz youre only making sandwiches got small pieces is good it helps the stringiness the rather good thing about this bread is that because its so py you can kind of wodge them sealed shut at the outside a bit of kind of like papy mashy work you know these are not meant to be perfect specimens theyre just its just kind of quick food on the run right milk first uh flour doesnt really matter i mean how much i use three spoons but i mean its just to dredge them in and egg now this is my favorite little implement cheap its called a magi whisk or magic whisk whatever its from france and it takes lump out of any sauce and its very good just for whisking up eggs or anything bit pepper and salt just for seasoning cuz mozzarella actually is quite bland i mean thats whats nice about it in a way which is why also i think this is wonderful with chili either in it or like tabasco dripped on top afterwards now i just kind of show the sandwich to the milk cuz this bread is really absorbent you dont want a kind of liquid sludge in the flour in the egg and in the pan okay im going to carry on with these ones i first had mozerella and cotza when i was chambermaid in italy what it means i surmised was mozzarella in a carriage this doesnt tell you a great deal um but i suppose it just means that its music contained now these just need to be fri fried until theyre golden on the outside and so theyll be golden and slightly crispy i mean not crunchy but slightly crispy on the outside and then really gooey and melting in the middle so i turn you can see where i havent sealed the bread brantly some of the cheese losing out which is great okay music ready lets cut this half and this is what you want all this kind of melting gooiness and when it goes into sps look look at that cheese flavor t music them thats music it that there i might often need to cook on the run but i still want something really substantial kind of supper eaten with a knife and pork this is chicken tereso and calini beans with a bit of kale very quick now one of the reasons i love this i mean apart from the taste is that its so easy easily thrown together minutes from lift off i reckon its not bad okay a bit of chicken stock concentrate in my simmering water look i know everyone will say you have to make chicken stock from fresh and otherwise its just despicable its not i like poaching the chicken here which just to say just cooking in the simmering water one because its very quick but also it keeps the chicken incredibly tender calini beans use any beans you want i like these my fencing mask i bought this um in new york i saw it there had no idea what it was for still dont of course i had to have it even though it meant having to like it back cheso which is just spanish sort of paprika sausage it used to be difficult to get it isnt at all now its from the supermarket its wonderful its sort of pearled with fat now because its cured youre just warming it through i dont want to fry it cuz i dont want to seal the edges just let everything ooze out okay bit of oil in the pan but only a bit just ordinary oil this is olive oil but not extra virgin because this will give off some fat and anyway you dont want a really strong taste cu the paprika will give it to you anyway as i say its just warming it through and letting everything just mellow beautiful i love kale its so kind of rich and iron heavy which is sort of perfect with the chicken and the beans quite blown the paprikas quite hot in the sausage and then this really its almost like a meaty vegetable so its really just a bit of plonking about in pans and now my fencing mask of beans now what happens is the paprika just oozes out of the sausage just begins to coat some of the beans which looks beautiful tastes better perfect if i can find my put my covers in such a mess right so thats the first bit beautiful see how useful this fencing mask is luckily i have asbestos hands f this out beautiful really wonderful and tender so just the last thing which is a bit of sweet smoked paprika on top of the chicken which makes it look beautiful but also it kind of brings the paprika taste again from the sausage although its not hot its just its just smoky and sweet and earthy and wonderful okay music supper on a working day you dont necessarily have time to shop your your supper so it makes sense to keep things in store so you can get yourself st to eat quickly one of my favorite puddings is vanilla ice cream with toasted pine nuts and warm honey now just cook these in a dry pan warm this in the microwave pour them over the ice cream and its fabulous my real lder standby is this marala which is fortified wine and you just slush it into any pan of meat or fish or cooking and youve got an instant sort of bubbling up gravy pasta obvious you know a quick working day supper linguini my favorite and what i love this with is with garlic infused olive oil and cubes of panetta i mean to be frank its hardly a recipe just three ingredients the pasta this panetta which is this italian bacon and some garlic infused olive oil you can use whatever you want ordinary olive oil and chop up some garlic but this frankly is easier especially after a long day at the office now what i always do is cut off the rind of the panetta simply because if i bung it in the dish with the oil it will give off all its fat and juices you can buy just bits of cubes of lard with the french equivalent in supermarkets thats already dice for you or else you can just get ordinary bacon and just cut it up right just smosh it about a bit with your hands i like a bit of handson work and the rest isnt sti it in the oven about or minutes should do it now i tend to salt pasta water always at this stage i mean it doesnt really matter obviously but unsalted water comes to the boil faster than salted water and im um im not a patient person every little helps right i tend to use about the same weight of pastors panetta half packet might just about do me there again it might not and just stir it about so it doesnt stick let it come up to the boil the packet instructions say minutes so i think well i got minutes to forget about everything the panettas in the oven thenen is in the water im not needed so just going to set my alarm minutes unwind and slip into something a little more music applause comfortable there is look at that wonderfully bronzed and crisp you can still see the pink bits just going to take off the fat and rind to eat alone in a private later and then strain this and now all you do is bug this in here and just mix it all up so all those wonderful bacony salty juices does dress the pasta you can just see all the the pasta darken in the sauce ill just tip it into a music bowl and then i do think pasta is good i cant really be bothered with chopping but you can just scissor it in and anyway because the panetta cubes are quite big its quite nice to have quite a rough bit of pasty on top let me just have a quick r of pepper right bed television food mim bruno breakfast ready me music thats enough music moo cooking something at breakfast time mad though it seems i promise you isnt about being a kind of deranged superwoman this is incredibly easy its a bit of orange ice cream and all you do is just put zest juice sugar cream whisk it and put it in the deep freeze and then when you take it out at the end of the day you know youve got your ice cream i first made this ice cream with seville oranges which are incredible because they have the flavor of orange but that in sour intensity of lemon but the only thing is you know theyre only available in january not that useful so i found by mixing just an ordinally sweet orange and two limes means that you get that same sourness and fragrance and hit but you know you can use lemon in fact you could use three lemons and make a lemon kn ice cream just whatever you want whatever youve got dont have to be precise about zesting just you know roughly do one whats really delicious with this bitter orange ice cream is chocolate sauce just put you know i dont know a bar of dark chocolate and an equal weight double cream in a sauce sp and melt them together its just delicious over it right so into the zest and juice its about g of icing sugar which does dissolved into the acid of the juice and the really brilliant thing about this is that you dont have a civic and the only kitchen job i really loow than to test is sving right big pot of cream thats it stir it i mean im going to whisk it in here but to be frank you can use just one of those little handheld electric whisks music you dont want this really plck the soft music piece thats music it and thats it in the deep freeze nothing else to do mimi bruno school come music on wait for music me you know just because something is unfamiliar doesnt mean its difficult to cook i mean this squid with salt and pepper is incredibly easy very quick and what is probably the simplest thing about about it is that this is the only ingredient you need to buy and you can get it frozen and keep it in the deep freeze the rest youre probably going to have in the house in other words some pepper corns and salt which you then very pleasurably smash the smin fine so the squid my squid lits look at these babies the baby squid is great its so tender so nice little rings beautiful keep the tentacles whole and when you fry them they just swell up like canton blossoms salt and pepper mixture just goes into a bit of corn flour and give it a good sort of swing around just so everything coats the squid oh this is a very good part you have got to feel a bit more relaxed at the end of the day after a bit of squelching and squeezing like this okay thats it now im going to turn this up just put a teeny bit of ring in to see if it sizzles and is ready thats right you know its really difficult to undercook squid when its as tender as this and you just see when they get rosy and start kind of bulging out of the fat a bit i just want to just s of lemon with this just to maintain the zen light music purity right we can tongue out look at music this so just lemon either your fingers or my uh special chopsticks for the terine competent you i want you to get your homework done now your music books the farm the farm but if you are going to be inviting friends over in the middle of the week for supper you really need to be sure you have food you can cook quickly easily and that doesnt need too much strenuous shopping this pumpkin and seafood curry is just that i mean im evangelical about this top of a can of coconut milk the top tends to be thick like this and then it gets sort of thin and watery underneath into that i use yellow curry paste you use red if you want i just love this golden color i use two tablespoonfuls some like it hot i like it very hot so just whisk these together all you know the curry paste and the thick bit of the milk will just mel together sort of golden aromatic sludge fine so now the rest of the coconut milk can you see look theyre running a bit then bit of fish stock and you know im using it out of a jar so this is all these liquid stocks that i seem to be addicted to put that in fish sauce got my jayla spoons three tablespoons although i cant be bothered to measure it but i taste so much this anyway right spoonful of sugar just to balance the sort of sweet sour intensity turmeric really this is just to enhance the kind of goldenness lovely lime leaves just snip them in lemongrass now i like this but you have to bruise the lemongrass by which i mean the flat of the knife on and press down and then kind of helps that lovely gentle sourness permeate that broth so just bring this to the boil and get on with the pumpkin you can use butternut squash if you want whatevers easier you need a kilo which sounds like a hideous amount but in fact its only these two pieces by the time youve peeled and seeded i often do a vegetarian version of this and for myself too and i am no vegetarian simply instead of fish stock i use vegetable stock and in place of the seafood a few cans of drained chickpeas its really fabulous oh so beautiful as well i mean thats sort of got to cheer you up okay in with a pumpkin why i like this particularly is what i find when you invite people around for supper especially after work they uh tend to be late what you do with this is you just cook the pumpkin until its tender and its so hard to say when that is cuz some seems take minutes some but once youve done that you can turn it off and leave it because the fish thats going in later will take minutes well pumpkins about tender all that happens now is you plonk in g thereabouts its pound in old money this is wonderful fish for curry cuz its so robust and it can really hold up to it well thorns now the only thing im going to be really bossy about here and i mean it is these prawns have to be raw just dont even bother with cooked brs just leave them out in that case this will take about i dont know to minutes not too demanding up to the boil let these cook cuz thats going to take hardly any time so just so i can keep busy im going to chop some coriander for lat now perfect thats done feg i like these packets of pack cho you can get but you can really use any vege
mhDJNfV7hjk,quick easy recipes with gordon ramsay,some of the best street food ive ever eaten was in asia every one of those little markets was filled with smells of delicious food that all centered around an asian staple noodles learn to cook those properly and youll be surprised how quick and easy it is to knock up a delicious dinner first off were going to soak our noodles now these are rice noodles into a bowl and just pour the hot water over the rice noodles soak and rehydrate to minutes to soften up if youve got a wok perfect if not just a normal size frying pan with big sloping sides pan on get it really nice and hot chicken breast very lean hardly any fat on there youve got this little fillet to slice that off now the secret to getting it really nice and thin and to cut it into strips take your knife keep it nice and flat on the board and sort of slice it in half like a sort of scallop like that we call this butterfly in the chicken take a rolling pin and nice and gently roll over the chicken what it does it sort of flattens it allows you to slice it even thinner and the thinner the slices of the chicken the sort of crisper it gets the quicker it cooks slice it in half start slicing these nice thin slices and the good news is one chicken breast can serve two or three easily next wash your knife and finely slice garlic the thinner the garlic the crispier music this is a young tender broccoli just slice them down i want a bite to the broccoli and normally you sort of paste the dish with onethird noodles onethird vegetables and onethird of your protein chicken music with a dish that takes literally minutes to put together its really important to get everything organized everything needs to be at your fingertips touch of olive oil get a pan really nice and ready just starting to smoke drop the chicken in first music salt pepper open up those little strands of chicken nice once youve started to sear off the chicken get the garlic in now let that get really nice and crispy the way to do it is to sort of spread all the chicken the garlic up the side of the pan can see why its so important to cut the chicken thin strips because it colors and cooks at the same time as well really really crucial now that garlics getting really nice and crispy broccoli in feels strange putting raw broccoli in like that normally well blanch it in boiling water dry it out but you want that crunch now soy sauce that helps to season it but also stains beautifully soy sauce in lovely its exactly what i want now take that out give you a pan a little wipe out a little teaspoon of olive oil get that wok really nicely oiled again drain your noodles theyre beautiful this is a really exciting way of finishing this quick stir fry very classic two eggs in music whisk up the eggs and give that a really good whisk music sort of almost spread it at the side of the pan lightly season the eggs noodles in chicken and broccoli in and give that a really nice mix you want the egg to sort of almost bring the dish together that eggs cooked music make sure youve got that nice even distribution of chicken broccoli garlic lovely and then just finish that fresh lime and then you have a very simple delicious stirfry with rice noodles music making your enoki is so simple to do yet the results are absolutely stunning and its a great way of using up leftover baked potatoes you can make noki just with flour and eggs however the potato gives it a nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture cut them in half take your spoon and scoop the inside of those potatoes im using leftover baked potatoes but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes two choices you can get a fork and sort of mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or this little gadget is called a ricer i suppose its a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently you can see how nice and light it is almost like fluffy little strands of potato you can do this when the potatoes are hot itll go through the rice so much quicker just slice that off there music now a nice spoon of okata ring a little touch of salt and pepper its really important to season the mixture as we go along otherwise the nokia becomes really bland flour over the ricotta sieve so theres no lumps one delicious egg give that a little whisk now make a little well in the center you want a nice soft pliable ball of dough give that a really good mix get some thyme flowers in there and this time is light fragrant and its just a really nice herb and with the ricotta it tastes brilliant just pick the little tips the time flowers next flour your hands generously and knead the mixture into a dough fold in and push and basically what its doing is get it nice and smooth as it starts to get a little bit wet and just add a little touch of flour we want something really nice and soft now dont overwork it it stops the nokia from expanding when it hits the pan thats exactly what i want a nice sort of soft fragrant ball cut the ball in half lightly flour the hands and just roll it gently just think of a big long cigar the mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots of flour now lightly flour the knife so when you slice the gnocchi it doesnt stick cut the dough into bitesized pieces just take your finger dip it in the flour and push down why i want my knocking to look like a pillow and for me the most important part there is that not one of them are identically the same shape water on bring up to the boil little touch of olive oil in there lightly flour your hand lift up the nokia in to the rolling boiling water turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you theyre cooked when they start floating get a pan on get that nice and hot now theyre just starting to come up to the top and you can continue cooking them like that i like blanching them in the water taking them out and then frying them to study the gnocchi heat olive oil in a frying pan gently lift up and look theyve doubled in size drain it get rid of the excess water and straight in to the hot pan music this is where they start to take on a completely different texture nice crisp sauteed texture on the outside nokia loves fresh pepper so pepper in and you see as i start turning them got this really nice little sort of brown color and theyre almost popping up now like little parcels so i want them nice and sauteed both sides but light and creamy in the center fresh garden peas in and the butter gives it a really nice sort of bernoulli flavour on the end beautiful put a little bit of fresh thyme over the peas and then finally i want to lift it up fresh lemon zest the lemon over music so smells incredible and then finally seal the deal with a touch of grated piles and cheese give your veg some attitude and youll get amazingly elegant dishes on a budget that are always guaranteed to impress what more do you want from great cooking cheap to make easy to cook and absolutely stunning for me food always has to be impressive but when it comes to desserts often you see spun sugar or wild decorations remember simple is always the most impressive this cheesecake is so straightforward yet so delicious now cream cheese leave it out the fridge for five or ten minutes go nice and soft trust me your arms will be thanking you sugar in this cheesecake is new york cheesecake because its baked it says no base start creaming the cheese and the sugar spending the amount of time i do in the states if theres one thing they know how to do out there is the most amazing impressive cheesecake rich delicious but so simple work the bowl lift the bowl to your advantage really whisk whisk whisk whisk lovely nice and creamy now get your eggs add the eggs to the mixture bit by bit doing it this way its more efficient hey youre incorporating a lot of air b the mixture doesnt separate music the last of your egg lovely of course you can use electric mixer but why go to the gym we can just make a cheesecake a day a cheesecake a day keep the bingo wings away now a couple of tablespoons of flour give it a whisk stop something going lumpy now i want to scent that cheesecake ive got the freshness zest the lemon in there i want to sort of tart it up even more fold in some fresh raspberries so just mix them through be careful to crush them then grease a cake tin with butter this will ensure your cheesecake slides out beautifully get your mix let that fall in now take your cake tin and just tap it the mixture hits the bottom of the cake tin the raspberries rise and youve got raspberries the top the middle and the bottom it also stops all those little pockets of air

at it its one of the simplest yet the most stylish cheesecakes anywhere beautiful music you
R63JO1dNY_c,every way to cook a potato ways,this is the potato guide im going to show you almost every way to make and cook one of the most beloved foods potatoes this is our biggest everyway so far total methods so lets make this simple almost every type of potato dish is cooked one of three ways roasted fried or boiled and thats exactly how well be breaking this up our taste testers are going to be eating every single dish and voting on a scale of to to determine the winner of each category but heres the catch once we find the winner of each category were going to combine each winner into a single super potato dish yes potato on potato on potato but does that make the greatest potato dish now listen there are three rules rule number one no crazy weird viral recipes were not going to shove a potato into a canon and blast into the stratosphere so everything must be a real proper recipe or technique rule number two it has to be widely accepted as a real potato dish and rule number three each recipe must be wholly focused on the potato okay no dumplings no breads just potato so our judges are ready to go were going to be raing this on a scale of one being the worst thing ever placed on the human tongue and being a golden potato sent down from the galactic heavens above so lets begin so were starting off with the roasted category number one starting off with a classic baked potato its very simple rub a large rusted potato with oil maybe not like that season the skin generously with salt and pepper it should stick bck at f or c for to minutes till crispy on the outside and fork tender on the inside typically youd fluff the insides and fill it with something but were going plain for a simple and fair rating viam me a and cam a five total this is the base to many great things but by itself it cant be as great as well the things that it can create this is peak average potato number two twice baked ill be honest i havent had many of these you take a fully baked potato cut the top third off scoop out the inside take that potato flesh and mash it up add some butter sour cream little splash of milk sliced chives graded cheddar mash thoroughly till combined now you can optionally spoon that all back into your carved out potato or you can mash it more fine and pipe it back into your potato were keeping it simple here pop that back into the oven at fhe or c for to minutes pull out and it should look like this now lets rate vicam a three myself a and cam a total points its a loaded baked potato with more work and im here for it thats kind of why im not here for it its nothing special its almost like a mashed potato inside a potato still a baked potato in disguise the secondary quality of baking it really does not add much to me moving on number three potato skins this is a very american thing i think another fully baked potato scoop the insides out obviously the insides can be used for mashed potato whatever figure it out now you crisp that up in a hot oven pull it out add a touch of unsalted butter into them some grated cheddar crispy chopped bacon you know the works back into the oven till the cheese is melted pull it out top with a do of sour cream and and a bech of thinly sliced green onion now hows a potato skin going a fair vicam a three me a five and cam a surprising seven jesus total points the exact same score is the twice baked theyre crispy cheesy the only thing that theyre really lacking is that creamy factor you have most of the potato removed so stuff on the inside is great but its out of like plus potatoes where does that rank pretty low thats how i feel too tastes great but ultimately its just a potato number four duchess potato this sounds like something thats coming from the era of the s i dont know if it is but usually that doesnt mean its going to be good starting with boiled potatoes we pass through a potato ricer heat her her medium constantly stir add some butter season with salt a little bit of heavy cream and this is the important part youre going to begin to mix four egg yolks one at a time until homogeneous get that whole mixture into a piping bag and pipe under the parchment paper into little flowers little twirls obviously you can use a piping tip if you want a nice little design pop new oven at f or c for to minutes or until they emerge like this lets taste vickram a me a five and cam a five our new leader flavors is awesome cuz the texture its unique doesnt mean its good ive never seen this before so i came in its completely blind they taste really airy almost like a dessert feels like a reinvention of a potato but at the end of the day what brings it down is it still tastes like a potato i wouldnt go out of my way to eat them moving on number five potato cero this is actually the duffing w potato from my cookbook the link to the book is in the description quite literally just sliced potatoes cheese cream it gets combined in a pan you bake it remove from the oven you get a beautiful bubbly doin w and now we rank vickram a me a nice but also i dont know why i squired my own dish like that in cam a with a total of six a big overall first place dish so far im scared to put too many sevens on the board theres so many things were eating i want to make sure we really pick the best potato dish potatoes cheese and cream you cannot go wrong with that combination now moving on number six smashed potato although they start with the par boil they get their finish by being baked so we have some parboiled small potatoes we lightly smash them coat them generously in any fat of choice could be vegetable oil duck fat whatever season with salt and pepper pop into a hot oven until gbd thats golden brown and delicious remove from the pan and put plate lets taste oo when things are really good sometimes it just comes out and the ratings come in at an a seven and a seven our new leader at its sort of this like best of every world in the potato world but why did we only give it a seven though cuz i feel like theres a ceiling on those i could eat anytime any day any amount thats why its an for me you get sort of a roasted potato and also a fried potato at the same time its luscious and creamy on the inside shockingly crispy on the outside if you do it right on to number seven smoked so into a smoker set to pop in one large rusted potato coated in a little bit of oil seasoned with salt and pepper and hours later it looks like this i do love things that are smoked now lets rank the rankings come in with a three a four and a four a total of points theres no smoky flavor to it and just overall let down i am shocked by how little smoke it picked up maybe if it had picked up more smoke i would have liked it more but at the same time its just not necessary i could see ways this could be done better but ultimately cooked this way certainly not the best number eight salt baked i love salt baking i dont know how i feel about it with a potato but youre going to get a whole lot of salt like g toss it with enough water until it has the consistency of packable snow put a layer of that on a baking tray followed by some new potatoes cover that up with the rest of your salt and pack it in like this pop into hot oven for to minutes pull it out use a m to break up the salt crust and lets see our salty adventure rankings come in with a four a four and a really tasty but you know at the same token nothing that special is it worth this amount of salt no and if that that crispy exterior those things would be hitting hard so slightly underwhelming number nine seol i mean we just sliced potatoes thin lightly oiled and season them and use myol which is an attachment on a blowtorch to diffuse the flame like this until they were cook through couldnt be too bad right so bad our votes come in with a zero a zero and a zero that is channel first triple not only is it bad but it absorbed just about every single living ounce of the gas of the fuel in the torch that is what really ruined this i mean if youve ever wanted to know what propane tastes like thats that i would love to say oh whats going to beat this its a zero what what you you dont get lower than that number the hassleback potato ive been annoyed by this potato dish for a long time so this better stand on its two legs get a large rust of potato squir it at eighth of an inch intervals all the way through the potato dont use chopsticks like in a little tik talks youre not a goooo gaga baby you can do this season it up and bake it in a hot oven until cook through and crisp looking it looks good but looks arent everything with votes at a three a four and a four a total of points no reason to do this in my opinion just bake the potato and call it a day if you want to crispy do something else on the exterior you get potato chip vibes which at this point just make a potato chip or eat a potato chip from a bag its a baked potato with extra work im just ecstatic that im never going to be making that again number broiled so this years all is kind of like broiling so i dont know how these are going to fare one large rusted potato peeled diced oiled up seasoned tossed pan and broiled for about to minutes i dont see this doing that well but the rankings came in at an a seven hang on cam is our differentiator here something happened here something happened and he comes in with a a total of we have a brand new unexpected leader if this wins i dont know what im going to do with myself why the are these so good this is the shop we got in the kitchen now take a look at this thats how good they are weve been eating these nonstop and while theyre talking im drooling trying not to eat this moving on number potato pave also called the thousand layer potato yes of course its not literally thousand layers but it looks like it so we have potato slices tossed in duck fat youre going to line them up in a paper lined loaf pan all the way up to the top as uniformly as possible cover with aluminum foil bake at fhe until cook through then remove the foil and press with another loaf pan and some cans to weigh it down put that in the fridge take it out portion it into little bars of potato season generously with salt and sear for to minutes per side in a hot pan its a beautiful thing lets taste so the breakings coming in at a whopping o a cams going to have to get a high score to even do any and an thats a little much youre a little less a total of our new leader by quite literally points i think its that good texturally on the outside crunchy inside its soft it goes deeper than your average french fry which i think is like texturally comparable to this i think this is one of the best ways you can eat a potato and compared to all the other dishes that are out there i mean its really good but is it that good theres so many more we have to taste number a global classic lemon potatoes these are also known as greek lemon potatoes so we got some yukon gold potatoes that have been peeled and cut into wedges pop those into a roasting pan some whole peeled garlic cloves a lot of olive oil you add some chicken stock a generous glug a fresh squeezed lemon juice salt to taste some aromatics like rosemary and youre going to pop those in a hot oven for to minutes and most of the liquid should be cooked out and absorbed by the potatoes with just oil left over to lightly fry them i mean they look nice and they smell real nice so lets vote a a and a gives lemon potatoes our new overall leader arguably of a non crispy potato one of the best ways you could probably eat a potato theres a new flavor that doesnt really go with potatoes that i havent had before the only thing that could take these up a notch is if they were crispy so moving on number pom deted fondant fondant potato weve seen these everywhere but are they really as good as everyone says they are trim the ends off a large rusted potato cut the potato in half should be x in pieces of potato seral potatoes on both sides on medium high till gbd reduce the heat to medium add some unsalted butter some aromatics and base for about to minutes and finally youre going to add a generous splash of high quality chicken stock bring to a boil and the pan goes into the oven to braze for to minutes until no liquid remains remove spoon a little bit of your butter on top of the potatoes it with some thinly sliced chives maybe some flaky salt one of the most famous classics and now we rank a six a and a i think its a really cool technique that has really good results depth of flavor texture yeah about there moving on number potato and pepot i dont know that this is the best way to cook a potato but whatever put some new potatoes in a parchment bag add some butter salt some aromatics like thyme and rosemary close that bad boy shut and pop into a medium oven for to minutes through from the oven and lets taste the ringings come in at a wo a two and a two a what what the cam this was not a good potato but why is it a cam the texture was okay and it was nice and creamy but other than that the skin was like not that crisp that you want out of a potato it was giving burnt paper bag vibes for no reason this method is kind of dumb you didnt really get much of the herbaceousness there from the herbs so its like yeah the herbs got killed wow potato and pepy o how about potato and peepy nope sorry that was stupid moving on to grilled were just doing this very basic one whole oiled rusted potato lightly seared on the hot side of a grill and then moov to the cooler side of the grill covered and cooked for more minutes remov from the grill and we taste its not that good a three a four and a four total points of it is an average baked potato what did it develop from being grilled the skin being burnt it is extremely hard not to char the skin and i thought well maybe a little char would be nice on this it wasnt its not really enjoyable on the outside but then the insides really soft and nice id rather just have a baked potato the only thing i liked about this was the texture that i got in the inside other than that its really subpar baked potato moving on to a pizza oven so obviously not everyone has a pizza oven but dont you want to know what it would be like if you ate a pizza oven potato we heat a large pan in our pizza oven which has been preheated about fhe so we add our oil to our pan add our russed potato season with salt and cook in the oven tossing occasionally for about to minutes thats how fast he cooked lets taste in the rankings came in at a five a four and another four total points so it was okay but maybe better on a pizza i will say heres a benefit to the pizza oven the speed it cooks really fast if you just want a cooked seasoned potato cook quickly theres your method moving on the next one direct coal cooking i want to wrap it in foil put it directly over coals but the problem is if you do that itll burn i got to create some sort of a barrier to prevent this i shove some skewers in it to create a barrier between the foil and the potato so it doesnt burn put it directly over some flaming coals then i thought what the hell are you doing josh this isnt a legitimate cooking method so we used the tandor instead my fine rose gold tandor its got to be one of the most expensive cooking utensils i have so it better deliver so we skewer a large rust of potato on the tandor skewer we oiled it we seasoned it we popped it in there for about minutes turning occasionally and now we taste a one a two and a a total of cant say im happy with that score wow one of the biggest losses for the tandor ever this did not benefit for being cook like that at all the outside was unnecessarily chewy very bitter even if we hadnt burnt it i just think it being above those hot coals for so long really not nice i mean inside was pretty much a little lower than an average baked potato and the outside is not really edible and doesnt have a good flavor to it either apparently vegetables just arent it for the tandor a shocking winner for the roasted category lemon potatoes moving on to the boiled category with you guessed it a boiled potato do you really need info on this you take a large rust of potato you put it in boiling water you could get for anywhere between to minutes or until fork tender its boring but is there beauty and simplicity lets find out vickram a me a and km three a lowly thats a little much to give it a one i feel like listen to me if you were able to take a bite into a potato just whole thats what it would taste like its really under average potato a boiled potato is clearly not the best way to eat a potato but it is a good like base thing maybe if they were dressed up theyd be better number poached this is a butter poach which seems unfair but how good could it actually be place one large rusted potato into lbs of melted unsalted butter cook for anywhere between minutes to and hours depending on how hot remove the potato season and lets taste vickram coming in with a two me a four and cam a six total this potato is really boring considering it was cooked in hot butter the butter just doesnt come through whatsoever it just tastes like a baked potato and youre using that much butter to just get a baked potato i thought this was kind of like an upgrade to a baked potato and to me this was just like slightly better because of that butter you know moving on number steamed which makes me sad but why would you do that but anyway add a potato to a steamer basket set over qu of boiling water and gently steam for minutes until fork tender now lets rank now the ratings come in with vickram at a jesus vickram myself with a and cam with a one a total of our lowest score yet and frankly not a surprise i think the biggest difference between this and the boiled is there was salt in the boiling water so that little bit of salt penetrated the potato so it tasted just that little bit better this is just a straight up potato like whatever you feel about a straight up potato that is this the potato doesnt taste bad its just super boring moving on number pm puree we have rice boiled potatoes and were going to most a whole pound of butter into that once some muli you add a nice generous glug of whole milk season to taste with salt and spoon immediately onto a plate its smooth its luscious but could it take the lead lets vote vicam a six h not looking good me a seven hang on and cam an eight a total for salty buttery rich very smooth potato it really pays respect to the potato but its very singular its a side its not a standalone dish in my opinion and if i have the choice between this and a mashed potato im going to pick a mashed potato im the exact opposite i would picked this over mashed potato out of times okay moving on on to another classic palm aligo aligot same exact recipes the pm puree but right before serving you fold in a lot of shredded grier cheese a little bit at a time until fully melted and you get a cheesy pulley potato now lets rank vick with a five a and an total to me id only eat like to four tablespoons of it its really filling really cheesy and its enjoyable for those couple bites but eating this much of it theres no way i could do that its an upgraded p puree so i upgraded my p puree scull ive never liked this as much as i like mashed potatoes i like cheese and mashed potatoes but i dont love it so its good but its not the king of mashed potatoes its funny how the classic pm puree beat this sometimes again theres beauty and simplicity on to another classic potato salad i love potato salad okay you can yell at me all you want i shant back down from what i adore so into a large mixing bowl crem fresh mayo garlic little bit of dijon little bit of lemon juice salt and pepper and some chopped parsley wh that all together and i have some chilled boiled peeled nicely yukon gold potatoes cut into bitesized pieces fold that in make sure to taste and season with additional salt and now our potato salad ratings im just kidding a five a seven and a seven total score of i think this deserved the higher score vicam decided to be mean today i love potato salad honestly im very biased its just a perfect thing you know its soft its refreshing but its also a little rich so many flavors but i think the beauty of it is how simple it is you know how mashed potatoes you can just keep eating and eating and you dont really realize how much youve eaten id say with potato salad you kind of know how much youre eating just because of the shape of it youre like okay cool thats like free potato are you doing math while youre eating but unlike a lot of potato dishes weve had today you cant just finish this whole thing moving on excuse me while prove vic im wrong number s i mean its pretty basic he puts a fingering potatoes in a vacuum bag aromatics salt pop it into celsius water bath for to hours pull them out and serve this is one of the most accurate ways to cook anything in the world so surely its going to rank pretty high so vicam comes in with an a a zero wao a two and a three i wonder if anything is even going to be able to get lower than this if its something i dont want to finish chewing its going to get a zero regardless but this straight up tastes like soap and from a texture position not any better than any other way to cook a potato its just more time and effort low and slow is not the answer moving on to number which is one of the most unusual ways ive ever seen a potato cooked in my entire life colombian salt crusted boil lbs of small potatoes in heavily salted water once it reaches a boil continue to boil and simmer for to minutes until all the liquid is evaporated from the pan and a light salt crust develops around the potatoes this looks kind of fun lets taste and the rankings came in at a four a five and a six points its a cooked potato that salty i mean its really not that crazy but they do taste good overly season a baked potato and you will have the same result funny enough this actually beat out the salt baked with a salt crust which makes absolutely no sense but well take it brother number the slow cooker another device i have always hated add lbs of fingerling potatoes tbsp of olive oil to your slow cooker season with salt mix it around and turn to high for to hours should be okay and now its time for a taste test first one with a one okay maybe not okay a two and a two little score five were never doing that again just grab a pan some oil and cook your potatoes normally dont put it in a slow cooker cuz its just going to be garbage you know its not as bad as the soused ones the potatoes are cooked properly and that is the only thing it has going for it number instant mashed potatoes i hate every every single ounce of this i have never in my life opened one of these bags before and because of you and my production team and everybody the editors i know youre watching this made me do this im not even going to describe it you take the stupid stuff you put it in a stupid bowl and you add hot water how disgusting is that i know that there are reasons that people use instant mash and im not judging you something about this hurts my soul anyway lets rank a a one and a three thank goodness this is not a leader total for you know how your mouth starts watering right before you throw up the thing i really dont like about them is they taste like margarine and not butter i can appreciate a good mashed potato and i wouldnt say this is the worst its not the best but for the economic reasons i think it is really high up there id say a lot of people have had this and had a good experience well if youre looking for something thats good this is nowhere on the spectrum whatsoever horrific moving on number one of the biggest heavy hitters in the world mashed potato so boil your potatoes in lightly salted water once for tender removed drain to keep this fair we mash these by hand till as fine as possible then we have a mixture of melted butter milk and heavy cream whis that in to your mashed potatoes season to taste with salt lets taste rankings come in at an a seven we may have a winner and a points total its creamy theres a depth of flavor to be had i could eat this with my dinner five nights a week its versatile you can add anything to it it has an amazing texture and its just classic this is one of my most favorite potato dishes of all time that means the mashed potatoes win the boiled category and im glad you know they deserve that our last category is the worlds favorite way to cook a potato fried starting off with home fries its barely a shallow fry but well put it in the fry category add some diced potatoes to a hot generously oiled pan at least just under a inch of oil add your seasonings of choice cook constantly for a few minutes add a little bit of butter toss together once theyre cooked through and brown nicely we taste a a five and a a total of points for a very okay dish tastes great youre never going to be disappointed with it but its only as good as the spices you put on it and thats it its above average because youre going to consistently get a good side you can make home fries pretty much with anything and theyll always be the same im not going to waste your time and repeat what they just said were looking for the greatest potato method we got to be harsh here moving on number diner style hash browns one of my very favorites hopefully a winner you got some shredded rinsed rusted potato and its very simple you get a grease griddle you heat it over medium heat you add a nice pile and you just let it cook to minutes once your bottom is gbd but the bottom of the potatoes you nasty and the top of starting to cook flip and cook on the other side until cook through now lets rank to which we ranked a six a six and an eight for a total of points i cant complain i wish it was a little higher though out of all the potato dishes on planet earth is this really going to be the winner its great for breakfast with some eggs and stuff but thats it its classic its great its a bit above average i dont know if it was exactly amazing but it took me to a place you had a ratatouille moment yeah thats beautiful number stir fry you ever thought to stir fry a potato so we have a hot walk with vegetable oil in it once it begins to smoke we added one pound of new potatoes to the walk which have been sliced in half and simply stir fry seasoning with salt to taste for to minutes theyre soft and crisped up now lets rank a a and a total of points the only thing i loved about these potatoes that elevated them to this level was the uniqueness and the nice flavorful qualities that it got from the walk and it brought out a certain flavor out of these potatoes that no other technique has done so far twisted the skins i dont know what im not getting that these guys are getting ive tried this a couple times now and im just trying to see if i can see the same thing and i really like the flavor so thats tough moving on number palm roasty this recipe you can actually find in the description which is in our video meal so easy a college student could make it these are actually very easy lets taste which came into at a ranking for a a and a total a point dub for an easy dish its crunchy on the outside but its like voluptuous and moist on the inside maybe voluptuous is not the right word hey siri what does voluptuous mean voluptuous means of a woman curvaceous and sexually attractive oh my goodness i dont know what i meant okay its really good its a seven very light airy crispy on the outside which is what you want out of potato and then a really soft buttery inside bonus points for being really easy to do its just a really well executed potato dish its cooked great on that outside gets the crunch you want and then it has that like nice soft potato center that you expect moving on next up potato latka probably one of the most famous fried potato cakes in the game so were picking this up with pre shaped lockas that are mixed up grated breasted potato onion egg and panko that gets tossed together formed into pucks and then gently shallow fried for about to two minutes per side until gbd now lets rank so the ranking s in with a a seven and an total of thats a tie with palm roasty you know honestly i think its because its a special dish but also you know theres some more aromatics in it and to me its just easier to eat i think by themselves theyre not as fun as they are with toppings with appy sauce and sour cream thats a but by itself its just kind of like an onion flavored hash brown ive loved luos my entire life when i was a kid i did used to just eat them plain but theres something special about the technique behind these to me the onion man thats drives it its reminiscent of a kimchi pancake so moving on next up palm doine another old recipe its literally just a potato ch pastry dough its shoe dough mixed with rice mashed potato so we pick these up from that point deep fry those bad boys until gb d they look like this theyre puffy fragrant and we rank ranking is at a a and a total its above average its good honestly very rich i will say out of any fried potato dish this is probably at the bottom for me what i didnt enjoy is you can really taste how oily it is and that kind of takes away from the eating experience its a crunchy slightly air rated fried potato you cant really go wrong with that situation but it might not blow you away thats just the takeaway moving on moving on to the croquet its a perfect thing to use leftover matched potatoes for but well see how good they really are so we have our leftover potatoes which weve rolled into balls and we bred in a threestep breading process into allpurpose flour then beaten eggs and finally tossed in breadcrumbs coated and deep fried until a beautiful gbd lets taste our votes come in with a a and an cameron really likes croquettes with a total of points making this a threeway tie with lacas and roasty theyre iconic and theyre good and theyre crunchy and its nice and all but i never order croquettes at a restaurant and i never crave them yeah theyre good ill eat one or two kind of dries your mouth out so thats kind of something its got going against it you bread and fry mashed potatoes thats an ultimate food sounds good on paper moving on ah my old friend the george foreman and by the way when i say old friend i mean arch nemesis i hate this thing but i will be honest it has performed well in these videos so we have sliced potato we greased them up season them put them in the george foreman and just let them do their thing pulled them out and now its time for a taste test and we ranked at a three a a three with a total of finally the george foreman out you know george foreman has surprised us in the past this time no theres not much to say about this other than george foreman sometimes works for some things i im shocked to say potatoes is not one of them it was just bad was real bad but not the worst weve had moving on next up palm sule another modified recipe from my book again you could buy it in the link in the description slice your potato extremely thin anywhere between an eighth or a th of inch it has to be transparent enough to see your fingers through it take two slices brush one with cornstarch and then brush the other optionally with egg white the egg white isnt a necessity but it does help adhere if its your first time press together use a ctim ring w to punch out little circles and fry at fhe basting often once theyve stopped bubbling and they have reached a gbd pop on a wire rack to drain and season with salt these are pretty cool i think these are better for cracking open and filling with a savory cremo but you know its up to you time to rate four a six and a five total score surprise but makes sense its kind of like a potato chip funny enough not as good as a potato chip technique wise it
Vy96iuq94Ko,woke flat earthers malik elassal stand up comedy,shout out to all the teachers that told me i never make it i just like to repeat stuff that rappers say like that makes me feel good but my teachers legit did not believe in me like i went to a muslim school like i went to islamic private school and i told them that i wanted to do comedy and they had never even heard of that so theyre just like no you want people to laugh at muslims i was like yeah kind of yeah i had another teacher who was also the imam he was like the religious leader and he found out that i wanted to do comedy and he took me aside in like a private moment and he said you want to be a funny guy huh you think this life is funny my friend funny in games when you see the power of allah on the day of judgment brother you will not be laughing and i was just like im still going to do it im still it made me want to do it even more so that i could be like all the rappers that i looked up to you know like i i did have teachers that did believe in me but thats not good for my narrative so i like to just focus i was listening to a meek mill song one time and in the middle of the song meek mill goes to the teachers that said i wouldnt make it here i spend a day with you make a year and i heard that and i was like im going to flex just like that as soon as i get on and then i became a comedian and its good a little hard to flex though to be honest with you like what could i even say to the teachers that said i wouldnt make it here ill make a year what you make a year like that doesnt sound as good you didnt believe in me and now were roommates dumbass good job yeah he told me i was going to starve in front of the whole class i remember he said you want to be a comedian youre going to be very hungry my friend and i wish he could see me now be like bro ive never been hungry a single day of my life cuz i still live with my parents did you think about that no you didnt im never hungry my mom cuts me fruit all the time and then she brings it into my room cuz she has zero boundaries she just walks right in my moms sick man shes a you know shes a shes a muslim woman she wears a hijab i dont look very muslim like just off off look so nobody ever bothers me about it you know she wears a hijab she looks muslim all the time one time she told me a story yeah its like a halloween costume she looks she looks muslim all the time you know so one time she told me that uh she was driving around and a guy pulled up next to her in traffic and saw that she was wearing the hijab and he like flipped her off and then he like followed her in his car for a while and i was like terrified when she told me this i didnt want to ask her this question but i asked i was like mom have you ever like thought about taking off your hijab and she was like malik i would rather rather die a martyr than let those people change me i was like all right tupac relax jesus chill out dont talk like that dont dont wish a would thats exactly the opposite of what i wanted shes nuts crazy talk but i was proud of her like i dont want her to change anything about herself but i want her to be safe so its like what do we do here you know like somethings got to change society is not going to change so its like we got to figure something out what im thinking of doing is coming out with a line of hate crime proof hijabs that my mom can wear completely hate crime proof okay first one im thinking standard just confederate flag hijab cuz listen thats going to short circuit nobodys going to know what to do when they see that next time some guy pulls up next to my mom and traffics and be like she got us she wore the piece of cloth that we like this is another one this is a this is a prototype i dont know if its ready for the streets just yet but um allh hijab but just a little bit pointy in the back just just a little bit pointy not all the way but just deceptively pointy just for some peace of mind i am looking for peace of mind man ive been ive been ive been going to a therapist for four years i think its a scam at least i dont have a good therapist like i cuz i didnt like get referred like by a doctor like i just like went online like i just like googled help please please help and then it took me to a website and on the website it was like write out a list of your problems so we can use that to like match you up and i was like all right and i selected anxiety cuz thats what i was thats what i was having and then it was like write out the anxiety explain what that feels like so that we can use that to better match you up to somebody and i was like its anxiety its not going to make sense i was like okay im not as good of a muslim as i was raised to be but i still feel like a good person you know and its i feel conflicted cuz in school they taught us that everything is written before were even born like all my decisions are made for me so its like am i just doomed to make these mistakes that god wrote for me like like what if allah judges me unfairly and then i submitted that and then they were like you should talk to helen about this helen helens good for like this shes shes on top of it trust me and i was like helen are you even listening to what what is helen going to do you couldnt have brought me like a dr mahmood el shabaz somebody to just tell me to pray brother your life is haram of course you feel terrible at least he understands whats im going to be in a meeting with helen shes going to be like tell me more about this allah character he sounds toxic i i mean why would you hang out with a guy like that who is he to judge you and im like well hes actually hes the only one who can so and thats my therapist helen ive been with helen for about four years thats and we get into argument its like ill fight with helen cuz like she just tries too much like too new age of ideas its not practical this is when i knew like i have to find someone else is when she asked me what my astrological sign was in the middle of a like my therapist was like whats your star sign i was like helen come on we cant both be mentally ill you know its got to be were just two crazy people yelling at each other now we dont need to be in an office shes like youre an aries and i was like youre good helen you can stay yeah im working on you know cuz i get angry a lot so im trying to figure out like whats good whats the right thing to get angry about cuz i like you know theres stuff thats like not worth it to get angry about like its just this is when i realized i i had to stop doing it was when um kyrie irving got in trouble when kyrie got in trouble that was that was big cuz like cuz i he was like my favorite basketball player hes one of the best basketball players of this generation and he yeah he got in trouble cuz he shared an anti semetic documentary on his twitter it was wild like he you know like in the documentary like denied the holocaust it was like nuts and like they wanted to kick him out of the nba and i agreed im like this is theres no place for that but then i i caught myself in the middle of it and i was like wait a second why am i even mad at this guy a year before this he said he thought the earth was flat like if a guy tells you that he thinks the earth is flat dont ask him about the jews like what are you doing what did you think he was going to hey if you walked in on your girlfriend cheating on you you dont need to be like let me see your phone right now unlock your phone i can see the way this guys hitting it from the back youre lying i can tell theres no woke flat earthers theres never been theres nobody whos like the earth is flat but you know i love everybody on it were all doing our best on this frisbee ride in space man thats traveling upwards to simulate gravity were all doing our best and we got to pay attention cuz its heating up the disc is heating up and the waters going to rise its going to pour off the sid we got to be careful people dont usually double up on causes like that theyre like the earth is flat and theres too many filipinos on it and its going to tip over if we dont find the edge that the jews are hiding from us and push them like who cares hes a basketball player it doesnt hes not making the rules kanye was the same thing that was tough for me when kanye got in trouble cuz ive been a kanye apologist my whole life every time kanye said something stupid i was always the guy in the back of the room being like just wait for the album bro like you dont even you dont get it hes in the future you wouldnt even youre not an artist how could you get it and then he was like im going to go defcon on the jews and i was like this better be a good album this sounds like the past yay to be honest with laughter you my uh my familys from lebanon you know im from canada like im raised in canada but my mom raised over in lebanon she tells me wild stories about what that was like for her in israel invaded lebanon so my mom grew up with like israeli tanks rolling through her village like they used to come into the house and do check stops all the time its a crazy way to grow up one day day the israeli military fired a missile at my grandmas house and it broke through the wall and just landed inside and just spun out and they just all had to like just didnt didnt explode the missile just did not go off and they all just had to like back away from the missile and just like pray that nothing happened and then the israeli military just came and like scooped it up theyre like sorry about that and then they just took it and laugh but if that missile went off i would have never existed like my whole family would have been vapor i wouldnt be here talking to you guys right now so i still listen to kanye sometimes you know like i feel thats fair bro when i woke up today and saw the news i was like my taping you guys are a dope proud thats good thank god bro i swear if im l bro my luck connie is going to drop tonight hes going to drop the most racist album youve ever heard so this is uh this is the first year of me doing standup where ive gotten to like travel a lot and its been very fun its its a lot of travel im not complaining but its you know its a lot so im trying to like figure out how to stream online that experience cuz i something would always go wrong i would lose my boarding pass or something and then i would be in the like the line fumbling with my email holding it up so i started doing this thing where id make my phone background my boarding pass just so itd be easy to scan in real quick but i also do this thing where sometimes before i come on stages i make my phone background like a list of my jokes just so its easy for me to reference just like one or two words to remind me and i forgot to switch it and i just went to get on the plane i just showed like a nice lady that works at the airport a list that said its islamic school prove them all wrong bulletproof hijab my therapist is the crazy one and israel payback and i was just sitting there like oh no no i just i think that stuffs funny thank you guys very much music w
8DNQ8DYgCJE,stand up comedy only introverts will understand paul snyder,now if you dont mind also give me a round of applause cuz i am a huge introvert and i left the house for this today so i uh i did my wordle and then i came on in so yes uh the introverts they are my people uh sometimes ill even ask by round of applause you know where the other introverts are in the room and that got it nailed it just a one solitary clap that was it and they are probably heading home right now just that was like i i overdid it that was exhausting i shouldnt have done that uh i i know i know my my people arent going to applaud i know this theyre uh they might give me like half a head knot and then were going to look right back at our shoes where its sayfe that is what my people do but i i feel like as a as an introvert and a comic i i i have the just the pleasure of sharing with the extroverts what the introverts have been talking about you know talkings kind of a strong word i think but i mean i mean we we have a group text all right thats thats what we have but heres heres just something that we that i i feel like id like to share with you guys that most introverts uh can agree with and that is that uh we missco you guys applause we that was the golden age of being that was our normandy you guys that we we stormed that beach and then we went home for years and we would do it again absolutely we would now one thing as an introvert i will tell you this i i try to treat everybody the way i want to be treated you know its kind of its the golden rule that wasnt the punchline yet but well get to it it it doesnt even matter to me if you are the ceo of a fortune company or just a homeless person on the side of the road you know i am not going to talk to either of you that is um probably should have led with that actually i i really tried to spin that into a noble cause but that didnt that didnt work uh i i think as an introvert im pretty comfortable with most things about it but theres one thing i do not like and that is confrontation i avoid confrontation at all costs you know if if if there is somebody mad at me or who does not like me at work i would rather go find a new job than ever have a conversation about it i i would ill be at the next job interview and theyll ask me why i left that last job and ill just be like well i accidentally reheated salmon in the microwave and there were some people that did not like that ill tell you that and i am just here for a fresh start heres how much i know i dont like confrontation uh i was dating a girl in college and i didnt think things were going well i thought it would be best if we just went our own separate ways and saw other people and i i sat her down and i told her that and she looked back at me and said nah i dont think so im going to be honest i did not know that was an option that had never been an option when the roles were reversed first but because i dont like confrontation i just went along with it and earlier this year we celebrated our th wedding anniversary guys i dont i dont know why youre applauding that is a cry for help i have been in a hostage situation that i cannot get out out of i could not be blinking any faster i need help no its fine i i think theres probably plenty of times in the last years where shes thought to herself i probably should have let him break up with me that that that is on me you know that is but we weve made it we have made it so far uh i know a lot of comics theyll theyll get up and talk about all the all the you know the the wonderful things they have done in life and i cannot do that i have lived a boring life i do not have a lot of uh accomplishments to talk about i i have still never seen an episode of game of thrones largely because i dont want to get caught using somebodys hbo max password i i dont need that kind of pressure in my life right now i dont i dont i i i went to private school so i i learned entitlement at a really young age i did that did that i think maybe the one of the edgiest things ive ever done i have finished every round of antibiotic ive ever been prescribed that that is as exciting as my life gets my my high schooler and i though were the same size so we can share clothes which i think is really awesome because it saves us money it is just a lot more embarrassing for her but but but we can do it we can uh something else about me i i i just want you guys to feel safe i have never been arrested um and i dont i dont even i dont say that to brag i know my own limitations you know i do i i think about consequences all the time i am not prison material you guys i i i know this although i ive had friends say no you you you are prison material and and i dont know why they have to say that with such a big smile on their face i i dont like their tone actually i think i should have better friends than that you know but i i havent i have never been arrested although in in sixth grade some friends dared me to steal a candy bar with them from from a gas station and and i went along with it and i came running out of that gas station clutching a package of worther originals i am not smart enough to do crime you guys my my friends came out with reeses peanut butter cup and mms and i went for the goto candy of the and over crowd i applause i dont know what my endgame was i dont i dont know if i was thinking of a mima i have no idea im not smart enough for crime but i i have always been fascinated by crime and i i think its because when i was young my parents introduced me to a little show called murder she wrote now i dont i dont know how many have seen murder she wrote in here but uh for just those of you who havent um um heres a quick synopsis it was a mystery of the week show it all took place in a sleepy little town called cabat cove maine and sleepy is really the only adjective you can use to describe a town with that much murder going on like they were just not paying attention at all like i i looked it up cavat cove had a population of people and approximately one person a week was murdered that show went on for seasons so out of people were murdered in cabat cove maine and i dont know why we dont talk about this more cavic cove maine is the most dangerous city in all of america and and the kicker of it is the police department did not solve a single one of those crimes not a they went over for a yearold retired author was the only one keeping that town together she was the only one the only one so that i think started my fascination with crime and then and then during covid i started watching a lot of crime documentaries on netflix and i dont know how many other people went down that rabbit hole but i went in a little too hard too fast okay and i messed up my whole netflix algorithm you know it it got to the point i started getting targeted ads on my phone from lowes and home depot just asking if i need rope or duct tape you know and they would bring that to my house i didnt even have to leave google maps just from salt l city here to provos google maps showed me five different places where i could dispose of a body you know and i i i put a pen in those i dont i dont know i dont know whats going to happen here tonight i just this could go downhill at any moment i dont know

Bq7O57JOFAM,why ralph barbosa gave his doctor a onestar review standup featuring,ive been going out to eat by myself lately but ill take my notebook with me so i can write little joke ideas and i noticed like in different parts of town sometimes people will try to guess what im writing in the notebook like whenever im in hood type areas people are usually like oh hes writing raps but whenever im in like a nice uptown starbucks then people are like ah hes writing raps one time i was like in a very like quiet lowkey coffee shop and this girl comes up to me shes like hey excuse me are you writing poetry i was like no im writing raps i try to hide my notebook and she tried to peek over my shoulder she was like how come it says jerk off right there i was like dont worry about that streets is crazy people die jerking off there try to eat healthy like im a im a type one diabetic and a lot of people dont believe me when i say that i think its because im im real slim you know its kind of like hearing a really ugly dude tell you he got herpes cuz people just look at you like you got it like you think you got it or the doctor told you you got it no doctor did tell me i was diagnosed like at and i had that same doctor from when i was up until i was which which was a long time to have one doctor so when i left i thought itd be nice to leave him a review on his website who knows him better than i do you know i was like this man was my doctor for the last years and i am still diabetic one star i left them one star because of the nurses he had working for him they used to try to lift you up but i didnt like it as theyll say things like you know in time you could actually find that diabetes could be somewhat of a blessing in disguise i think id rather have just a regular blessing the disguise part is really messing with my blood sugar youre a horrible nurse but i took her advice years down the line though i was at a bar and some of my friends started a little fight this dude pushed me so in my head i was like diabetes music i didnt want to fight him so i said hey man you dont want to do this im diabetic and this is one of those little things that sucks about living in america he goes me too and then punch me in my face ive never cared about like a weight problem or diabetes problem in this country but when that happened i was like this is out of control mans diabetes i saw it as like come on man we got to stick together but he saw it as like nah two types walked in one types walking out but i do i go out to eat a lot ive been having this problem at restaurants where i get skipped in lines pretty much every time by white women not saying im angry im just saying its usually you guys but i dont think its a race thing like i dont think white women are skipping me because im hispanic i think white women are skipping me because im short and his panic like hear me out you see a ot latino dude standing in line that dude has the potential to be tall tan handsome you respect that mans place in that line but they see me hispanic dude in line and their mind theyre probably thinking he probably works here im just get in front like i dont say anything though i dont i dont really think its a big deal if anybodys wrong in the situation its me cuz if its a goodlooking white girl im like man whatever but if its like a white woman that has a ring on her finger then im like racist i i dont i dont say anything though i i feel like i learned my lesson once cuz i skipped the white woman once and i got in front of her and she goes youre going to regret that i was like whatever i didnt think nothing of it ill brush it off then like days later i went to my old neighborhood to visit my grandma and they turned their house into a yoga studio i was like ah they got me honestly i kind of like when i get skipped by white ladies only the older ones cuz they do it with like some guts behind it with some attitude you know like older white ladies with the little glasses theyll get right in front of you and they look back at you like what go ahead say something this is a target who do you think theyll believe im like fair enough fair enough i dont know where i fit in but i i really dont like i cant even hang out with my thug friends anymore cuz well be smoking together and then they like to say cool thug but itll also hurt my feelings a lot of the time they get real dramatic when they hit the joint it be like man do you know when i think about it all my real friends are either in dead or in jail by now im like give me back my weed man changing my hulu password too thats for my real friends i got like my suburban friends too theyre like college kid preppy type people very cocky like they can never answer questions by saying yes or no they always got to say stuff like you know me thats weird that is the strangest way to answer a question talk to my buddy james i was like yo james a couple weeks ago we were hanging out at that bar and you seem to hit it off with that one girl and ive been meaning to ask you uh did you two go home together he was like ralph you know me you know me i was like dude shes been missing for like days man i dont know you at all my educator friends are trying to get me into to politics more theyre like man you dont you dont ever see these immigrant stories on the news and get upset you know what i mean cuz cuz our parents were immigrants dont doesnt it make you mad the way they treat people was like i dont watch it but i mean ill try because i get it everybody has something to be offended by you know like and i want to be a part of my people i want to find something to get offended about i want to be mad i was watching all different political channels but i couldnt care much until i started watching cnn they were doing this special on china and now i started getting a little offended right it caught me the first thing that caught me of americans dont trust president gping and i dont think thats true because i dont think of us knew china had a president called my buddy pun cuz hes from china i was like yo you guys have a president in china he says no he said its more of like a chairman position i was like oh well i dont trust him and i kept watching he said the biggest threat to our country is the country of china china and thats where i got mad because china has not only clothed and fed me for the last something years but after every meal they give me a little message of inspiration chinas my biggest threat no ill believe theyre my mom before i believe theyre my biggest threat they start pressuring me to vote a lot i dont like that either i miss being a little kid getting pressured into more human things like gangs drugs you knew which one was dangerous but with voting you can never pick a right side sometimes you know you think you know and then then somebody comes out of the shadows with some hidden facts that they read online its hard to know its true or not youll be like hey yeah im going go uh democrat cuz i heard they got a good health plan theyre like no yeah they do its a good choice then out of the shadow somebody pops up like but also they eat children oh okay i dont want that let me check out the republican side and you get the facts on them oh yeah they got a good budget plan theyre really theyre really trying to fix up the economy youll like it and then out of those same shadows somebody pops up with like but also theyre the ones who purchased the children like im good on kids man im i do want to vote i do want to but honestly i want to do it for bragging rights i feel like one day theres going to be a badass president who legalizes all sorts of cool things across the country like mushrooms weed prostitutes not saying im just going to go indulge in all of these but i i would like to think if you know by some circumstance i find myself sharing a legitimate blunt with a legal prostitute as we file her w in that moment i want to be like youre welcome by the way i voted i did this like its just scary like you you really do got to get informed man you cant you cant just make a snap decision like im but i dont feel like im old enough to vote you know like i i want to pick a president but at this age like im im still learning how to pick good mechanics i got my wheel alignment the other day by a dude who guessed the price off the top of his head i just pulled in i was like excuse me sir uh how much is it for a wheel music alignment he kicking my tires i just looked at him like i i dont know either but i went with him cuz he seemed trustworthy enough but my car drives more crooked now than when i gave it to him i dont know much about cars or politics but i do know this i do know that sometimes people running for office scare me for the same reason that mechanics scare me have you ever noticed people who run for office talk about the country the same way mechanics talk about your car theyre like can i fix it yes but i got to take it apart from the inside really its going to take me some time especially especially cuz look i dont know if you saw this but the guy who had it before me he really this up

im going to snap and be like im recording in a starbucks noow looking back i mean im from long island new york so its my destiny hey trash how you doing and its good to have you here i was just uh i was just there visiting my sister and her wife and their baby and i love than my sister married a woman cuz she dated men her whole life so it was really fun to watch my parents malfunction it was the best it was so funny cuz they were always like we love the gays and then my sister brought home a woman and they were like know know they were so surprised i wasnt surprised i thought about the men she dated before this girl and i was like i too would try something new for sure it is so funny to watch liberal parents get challenged i wish it on everyone let me tell you something because we always thought we had the most liberal parents in the world especially my mom my mom used to raise us saying things like no matter what man youll bring home whether hes black asian muslim we will love you and him no matter what and then my sister was like im in love with a woman and i swear to god my mom was like i said black asian laughter muslim i mean listen i have empathy for my mom its pretty easy to be liberal and be like do whatever you want to do just be happy but when that thing comes at you youre like wait hold on i didnt i didnt know like i just looked up today theres so many different types of relationships out there right like theres like open and i dont know thats all i can they like you know what im saying right and i i would never judge anyone in one like if you said you were in an open relationship id be like good for you i mean i dont know if youre together but i would probably pull you aside and be like are you okay um but like if my husband woke up tomorrow was like i think im polyamorous think the again i love him though hes a white guy from vermont so hes exotic and yes yes he loves to go hiking its this big thing i i mess with him im like hiking to me is like giving you a cuz its a lot of work i dont really love the view and youre in front of me saying than like just a little bit longer im like okay and then we get to the end and youre like how do

worth it its always one lunatic man thats running up behind you like on your right and its like like i uh i always bring our english bulldog with us on hikes i do cuz hes an athlete and i bring that dog everywhere we go um theres always one person that fat shames him its just and theres always one girl thats like is that a rescue did you get your dog from her theres a lot of dogs are you a piece of or did you rescue your dog do like look at him hes like ha ha im like i rescue him every morning with a cpap machine i promise you im doing the lords work here but i met my guy really young i was years old which i thought was right on time cuz i was a millennial girl that was like you got to meet a man in your s and then get married and then be miserable and then cry at a taylor swift concert but thats why i like jen girls cuz they dont really fall under a timeline they dont hold men in such high regard i feel like millennial girls we kind of messed up when it came to dating and then jenzy girls will leave a guy for an ick like soon as they get it which is so entertaining because the ick that you its always something intangible that the guy cant control its amazing youll just ghost a guy and be like i dont know i just like saw him run with a backpack on and i get him me i i got the ick on the first im happy im glad i stuck it out but i just didnt have a word for it on the first day with the man im with now i watched him spray cologne in the air and walk through it i was in the corner like huh okay no hes a nice guy huh okay i uh i like i have a lot of jenzy friends i do they they i like the pronouns that they brought to you know whatever i do i like pronouns i like how it makes people feel like they they are who they are they identify they feel good um i you know but when someone introduces themselves to me with multiple pronouns i short circuit i panic my brain starts doing like math equations im not going to lie some guy introduces himself to me and is like hi my name is james i go by he him they them my brain is like okay if hes driving a car at mes an hour and they pass mile marker at pm at what point do i panic and just say like hey you i like i i love how long ive been with this guy hes years and i i love it because we we do so many cliche things as a married couple one of them being like i always want a vent and he always wants wants a problem solve you guys know what im talking about here yeah yeah one person definitely feels it in his soul in that moment when that happens i just i just wish he would be a little fem just for like a second just whenever just one time i want to complain to him and him be like oh my god no way lets have two martinis and talk about it but instead every time i talk to him i feel like im talking to siri like no matter what i say hell be like i didnt get that heres a list of things i found online that i think might help you and the list is always just motivational sports stories thats all we got man thats it like i came home the other night i was it was a bad day easy to have in new york and i walked through the dorm in tears and im like this hes like so overwhelming like i saw a man poop in a shoe and

on adderal when theyre learning disabled but when youre learning disabled its a rough moment when youre put on drugs cuz adderal doesnt teach you how to read right just makes you focus long enough to

pMMwzve-Omc,dear hollywood celebrities nobody cares,now it might have come to your attention that there was an election in america this week no way i know right if only someone had told us now im not here to talk about the election itself because believe it or not im generally smart enough not to stick my nose into things that are none of my damn business but do you know who isnt hi you guys hi avengers thats right whenever theres a major political or social event going on you can always count on the professional pretender to find a way to make it all about them because truly who better to guide the common working man on which candidate best represents their interest than a group of elite multimillionaires living in a goldplated echo chamber whose entire careers consist of saying words written by someone else the list of actors and celebrities that are apparently going to leave america because the election didnt go the way they wanted is longer than my criminal record for public intoxication but like what kind of threat is that even supposed to be why do you think anyone even cares where you live do you really think theres people out there that are deeply invested in keeping you in the same zip codes like if you threatened to never appear in any movies or show your face in public ever again i guess that might be something a bit more meaningful but then that would actually mean putting your career on the line no more big pay checks no more private jets no more awards ceremonies where you sniff each others farts and talk about how good it smells and we all know youd never do that because if you dont have fame and attention anymore what do you really have left to keep you going and now that it actually is all over i wonder how many of those people are actually going to go through with it anyway probably about the same number who left the country years ago when the same exact thing happens gay damn man they even managed to bribe sorry persuade the avengers cast to do a totally authentic zoom call where they gushed about how much they loved chosen candidate hi you guys hi avengers jumping on the call whoa whoa whoa i think you mean assembling thats pretty good no they that was funny oh my goodness this is almost as authentic as brie larsons youtube channel everything from the empty threats to leave the country to the halfhearted monotone endorsements where you could practically see the dump trucks full of money depositing their load in the background to the endless twitter post ranting about how the orange man is going to blow up the world or something it all just came across as so fake and hollow and out of touch just another performance by people who spend their whole lives pretending to be someone else and when thats your job when thats literally the only thing people know you for its kind of hard for them to take you seriously when youre trying to be all earnest and authentic and when i think about it the whole concept of celebrity endorsements just seems so tired and dated now like some weird relic from a different time a time when people actually used to look up to actors and celebrities like the simple fact of being famous somehow injects you with wisdom and knowledge far beyond mere mortals like ourselves well whatever bubble that once existed is well and truly burst now because honestly i think might go down in history as the year when people finally completely and totally stopped giving a what movie stars have to say about politics i mean the writings been on the wall for a while now social media gave us an unparalleled insight into the minds and im using that term pretty loosely here of our favorite icons of the big screen but instead of making them more accessible and giving them a new platform to influence the masses all it really did was lift the curtain on how dull mundane petty and needy so many of them are driven by a constant need for attention and validation parting the same predictable and safe talking points or trying to shield the overpriced crap that theyve decided to slap their name on the more they tried to act like regular people the more fake they ended up looking the relevance and respect they command has been declining for years now and its been reflected in the crater and viewing figures for all their big awards shows which had gradually devolved into political soap boxes that nobody was interested in listening to things only got worse during the unspecified virus of unknown origin where celebrities had never looked more preachy arrogant and out of touch with reality yeah sure you guys sit in your million mansions in beverly hills with private gyms hot tubs and acres of land to walk around and tell the rest of us why we have to stay indoors in onebedroom apartments because were all in this together sh oh yes thats yeah you guys must have been crying into your champagne while all this was going on i honestly dont know how you made it through but holy i think this is the year when any shred of cultural influence they had just went right out the window and i think they know it there was like hours of complete radio silence after the election i mean even mark hamill couldnt think of anything to say and normally you cant get that guy to shut the up about politics it was like the whole celebrity ecosystem had just taken a giant slap to the face and simply couldnt come to terms with it well that is why im here to help now this is going to be a bitter pill to swallow hollywood people but just like tatiana swallow you must and not to worry because dr drinker is here to administer your medicine the cold hard truth here is that nobody gives a about your political opinions anymore you are some of the least qualified people in the world to be lecturing normal people on how to think and vote because youre not normal people you dont work normal jobs you dont live normal lives you exist in a nice comfortable bubble that protects and insulates you from reality where youre surrounded by other people just like yourselves and the thing is we dont actually hate you for that theres nothing wrong with being rich and successful if youve earned it and part of being rich and successful is that you end up getting a bit detached from the mundane reality of daily life again we understand and lets be honest its kind of cool to be an actor you guys get to do stuff and go places that most of us could never dream of and were happy to cheer and boo the character characters that you play were happy to be captivated by the performances you deliver were happy to listen to you talk about your craft and share stories and insights into what its like making movies but what were not prepared to do anymore is be lectured by you or told what causes were supposed to support by you or how to think and vote by you this next bit is going to take a bit of humility and selfreflection which i realize are two qualities youre not exactly hot on but its time to shut the up about this stuff its none of your business its not your area of expert teas and it never was learn that lesson and you might just get back the respect and attention that you want learn it not and well you might just find out how fickle a mistress fame really is anyway thats all ive got for today go away now

letterman is there something wrong i cant be the first one to make you feel weird about it no i guess not wearing sunglasses and a big bushy beard phoenix mumbled awkwardly through the discussion causing the host to take verbal shots at him what uh what can you tell us about your days with the unibomber while this turned out to be a spook for his mockumentary im still here the media genuinely believed phoenix was having a breakdown and producers stayed away from him but you you are youre not going to act anymore no huh why is that i dont know the actor admitted in a later interview that the quality of script sent to entice him had vastly dropped after the stunt it took several critically acclaimed projects to put phoenixs career back on track thank you for letting me come on the show we weve been dying to have you back a year and a half number belle gibson are you prepared to tell the truth today the whole truth no half absolutely truth no gobbley go the truth no ive been really transparent in australian bell gibson was one of the hottest new wellness influencers on the market after launching her mobile app the whole pantry after releasing various cookbooks life seemed to be going great for her but then gibson told the world she had contracted several cancers but was managing the progression with her healthy lifestyle now youve just admitted that you didnt say it was at your home and it wasnt with a real doctor because you thought appointed in you no i believed he was a real doctor yet in rumors emerged that gibson was lying about having the disease and her donations to charity ive been openly conveying and speaking about what was my reality and what is my reality today well you accept that your reality does not actually match reality with the pressure mounting she spoke with the magazine the australian womens weekly where she admitted shed been lying and blamed her behavior on her upbringing this tanked her career in an instant in gibson was fined for her deceptions despite being given a four month deadline youre still alive yeah was that an indicator to you that you didnt have brain cancer it wasnt an indicator number alex peder if youre a blossoming actor in hollywood its not a great idea to slam the city where you make a living but thats what englands alex peder did in after making his name in i am number four and stormbreaker the actors career appeared to be going swell then peder spoke to vman for an article within it he slated los angeles in an exploitive filled interview among many many insults he called the city a quote insidious pool and socially quote disgusting slated the women living there and described an acting career like being in prison yikes this on top of a reputation as being difficult to work with caused peders career to stagnate as big budget productions looked elsewhere for talent number tom cruz was a dark mark in the career of tom cruz firstly there was his bizarre behavior on the oprah winfrey show ive never seen you like that ive never seen that i know cruz followed that by publicly criticizing brook shields for admitting she used antidepressants after developing postpartum depression the actor then went on to the today program to speak with matt low about his opinions and it was rough im just living my life and and im doing the best that i can and doing it in a way that i feel is is right an erratic cru doubled down on his anti psychiatry views calling it a quote pseudo science and i know that uh psychiatry is is a pseudo science his very patronizing approach did cruise no favors as he combed lows questions with all the scandal paramount pictures cut ties with the actor in after years but eventually that relationship recovered steven spielberg also denounced cruzs actions in however the duo reconciled in weve never seen you behave this way before i know have you ever felt this way before number pierce morgan by thanks to poor ratings pierce morgans reign on cnn was ending in his final days he interviewed comedian chelsea handler and she wrecked him handler slated his lack of attention and called him a quote terrible interviewer i mean you cant even pay attention for seconds youre a terrible interviewer well you just werent keeping my attention thats not my problem while morgan attempted to save face by claiming the guest had to be interesting handler pointed out that it was his job to do that this is your show you have to pay attention to the guests that you invited on your show interesting enough yeah they are listen it doesnt matter how interesting i am you signed up for this job well maybe thats why your job is coming to an end with his us reputation in shambles morgan returned to the uk and joined good morning britain this is a hour trash aon of our royal family but after he went off on a rant about megan markle disclosing her mental health struggles he was called out by fellow presenter alex barisford causing morgan to walk off but yet you continue to trash her okay im done with this sorry oh do you know what thats track not my see later later he resigned from the show and has struggled for relevance since absolutely diabolical behavior number liam niss this interview had social media bursting at the seams with comments for and against the irish actor while promoting one of his movies nissan opened up in an interview about the time one of his close friends was sexually assaulted by a black man to to get rid of this im im not racist i i i this was nearly years ago but because i was brought up and maybe im rabbiting on robin forgive me i was brought up in the north of ireland and and brought up in the troubles he said that after finding out he walked the streets looking for trouble hoping to kill a black man before realizing that what he was doing was wrong and feeling ashamed of himself many branded him a racist while others defended his honesty including celebrities such as trevor noah and whoopy goldberg because i believe that liam n deserves a medal and ill tell you why it may not have destroyed his career but it certainly put a fork in the road of his likability number john mayer at one point john mayer had the reputation of a quality musician who was seemingly going to reach legendary status one day but then he spoke to playboy magazine in and destroyed that possibility he is giving this interview to playboy magazine he wants to be provocative and he tried a little too hard on top of being gross about his past relationships with jessica simpson and jennifer aniston sexually it was crazy mayor compared quote little john to white supremacist david duke and threw in racial slurs a couple of times yikes while mayor apologized on social media in other interviews and at gigs he never reached those lofty heights again none of his released singles have reached the top on the us billboard chart since s half of my heart with taylor swift oh half of my heart got a grip on the situation half my heart tak time number chris harrison for years chris harrison was an american icon with his work on the bachelor and its spinoff the bachelorette and many more but then in he was interviewed by rachel lindsay a former bachelorette for extra this is when his career fell off harrison discussed the actions of alumni rachel kirk connell after photos of of her at college attending a plantation themed party came out and liked racial posts on social media is it a good look in or is it not a good look in because a big difference ever its hard to defend that but harrison did his best even throwing in the term woke police and saying people shouldnt judge ew the public backlash was massive lindsay quit the franchise due to her disgust at harrison he was suspended and later fired by the bachelor anabell and parties are not okay past present future number pauline im so happy to be showing yall my new stone wear specializing in southern cooking pauline seemed like a nice and kind person during her cooking show paulas best dishes but when a lawsuit came her way in her deposition threw that assumption in the bin when she stated she used racial slurs several times and had considered a plantation themed wedding yikes as the backlash grew dean was interviewed on the today show to discuss the controversy and it was weird if theres anyone out there that has never said something they they wish they could take back painting herself as a victim of slander she stated she wouldnt have fired herself for the fallout but most notable was the lack of sorry from dean except for referring to an apology ology video shed made afterward more companies cut ties with dean as she fell into obscurity number michael jackson interviewed by martin basher for a year and broadcast to the world in the documentary living with michael jackson shocked viewers with a couple of massive revelations from the singer these we bought yes and these yes this table these these firstly jack spoke about the abuse he sustained at his fathers hands when he grew up but then the thriller performer stated that he had had sleepovers with children in his bedroom but he emphasized that nothing unto happened when gavin was there he talked about the fact that he shares your bedroom yes can you understand why people would worry about that cuz theyre ignorant the backlash was massive from the public this brought to life the infamous trial of the people versus jackson in five while jackson was acquitted on all counts the damage done to his reputation was permanent on top of that he faced bankruptcy from other lawsuits before he passed away in black people were called colored people because we come in all colors from very white as white as my hand to very dark number lance armstrong seen as a hero for facing cancer and becoming a dominant force in professional cycling lance armstrong was beloved and one of the best athletes ever but then the rumors that he had had all his success on the back of

millions of dollars did you ever use any other baned substances like testosterone uh cortisone or human growth hormone yes number nine billy bush while not an official interview person say were going to allow this access hollywood footage due to how notorious and career ruining it became it was actually captured before presenter billy bush and donald trump were able to cruise into a tv studio to do some filming and while they were unaware that their microphones were on i moved on her actually you know she was down on palm beach i moved on her and i failed ill admit it i did try she was married s while on the bus they riff about trumps sexual escapades which in include groping women and discuss how power can give you free reign to do whatever you want i better use some tic tacs just in case they start kissing her you know im automatically attracted to beautiful i just start kissing them its like a magnet you just kiss i dont even way and when youre a star they let you do it you can do anything whatever you want grab them by the we even hear them talking about how attractive they think days of our lives actress arian zucker is before meeting her when they get off the bus bush was suspended from his job on the today show following a ratings drop and subsequently resigned he since had to repeatedly defend himself in interviews the moment that is on that tape i understand peoples reaction i agree i also felt that way number eight seconds of summer if youre a ban being interviewed by rolling stone magazine is a big big deal so much so that it can be easy to get carried away with trying to sound overtly rock and roll and thats exactly what happened with the band seconds of summer in a interview the band did everything from compare themselves to the beatles to dismissing or insulting the american music awards justin bieber and their female fan base also known as most of their fan base they were criticized for their comments and for generally sounding like narcissistic pradas it probably didnt help that they appeared naked on the front cover either number seven paula abdul what do idol fans have to look forward to this season and what are you looking forward to seeing well is that what it is i was wondering what is that you know when youre under the influence but you dont think you sound like you are well theres a good chance that paula abdul knows what that feels like at least in hindsight in this interview shes promoting the latest series of american idol while she would later dismiss the idea as lies many viewers wondered if shed had a few drinks or partaken in another type of stimuli delayed responses bouts of laughter this one has it all you know what they said listen any publicity is good publicity you got to learn to eat it up and and embrace it and say seattle had the best delusional people the interview went viral becoming an inescapable part of abduls career years later she left american idol as a judge due to a dispute over wages and dropped out of the public eye for a while number six the chain smokers next up we have another misguided attempt at sounding hardcore in a magazine interview this time courtesy of the musical duo the chain smokers who let it all hang out with billboard everyone was making the same thing and after a few years it got really stale and only a few people started breaking off from that and experimenting when asked about their manic musical romps they were all too eager to brag about their wild frat boy image and pensent for sleeping with as many girls as possible even though they both had girlfriends the two were heavily criticized and briefly became became the talk of the musical world for all the wrong reasons but we shouldnt hate on them too much right like they said quote were just frat boro dudes you know what i mean loving ladies and stuff thats an actual quote word for word number five prince andrew deemed a car crash by many this interview ultimately resulted in prince andrew stepping down from public duties for the royal family today youve chosen to speak out for the first time why have you decided to talk now when bbcs emily matless questioned him about his close ties to convicted sex offender jeffrey epstein the princes answer raised many an eyebrow for starters prince andrew straight up denied ever meeting his accuser virginia roberts i have no recollection of ever meeting this lady none whatsoever despite photographic evidence to the contrary there were other shocking answers littered throughout like saying he didnt regret his friendship with epstein as it presented him with useful opportunities the interviewer is clearly impressed with his answers much like pretty much everyone else who watched it he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming yes unbecoming he was a sex offender yeah im sorry im being polite number four katherine hagall higel has long had a reputation for being difficult to work with but a interview with vanity fair proved particularly damning when she criticized the movie knocked up which she just start in she branded the movie quote a little sexist and critiqued the the way in which it portrays women which frustrated people considering that she decided to be in the movie a year later she starred in the movie the ugly truth which was widely panned as misogynistic whos this delightful creature im your producer hey i like it when on top as a result of the entire episode already hesitant directors were given yet another reason to be cautious about working with her im going to be really honest right now im not i know im not i dont have to think about it im not a rude person im not an unkind or mean person number three megan fox as a general rule its probably not a good idea to compare the director youre working with to hitler but thats what transformers star megan fox did in an interview with british magazine wonderland talking about michael bas conduct on set fox compared the director to the nazi leader which was soon all over the media wa nice headers youve got a highrise double pump carburetor thats pretty impressive soon double pump it ultimately resulted in her being fired from the transformers franchise but not by ba according to ba it was the franchises executive producer a certain steven spielberg who insisted she be fired shes since worked with ba again on the teenage mutant ninja turtles films which the latter produced but foxs notable roles have otherwise been few and far between since giving this interview hi guys this is april oneal from channel news and i am here in beautiful new york city on the first day of spring and you know what that means it is time to shed that pesky winter weight number two charlie sheen this guy has said and done some seriously shocking and controversial things in his career but the reason hes on todays list may surprise you the interview in question is his appearance on the today show where he announced that he was hiv positive they walked in the room and said boom heres whats going on its its its its its a hard um three letters to absorb you know its a its its its its a turning in in in ones life while some praised his bravery many criticized the fact that it had taken him years to go public with it stating that it could have endangered his sexual partners were these people that you had had sexual contact with and were claiming that you had transmitted the virus to them or were these people who simply found out about your status and were threatening to tell the world people also took aim at sheens surprisingly calm demeanor as he told of his diagnosis and battle with people blackmailing him for some the interview humanized sheen more than ever before for others it further solidified his reputation as being reckless particularly with the lives of others have you had unprotected sex on any occasion since youre diagnosis yes but but the two people that that that i did that with um

for you yes um respectful ill be respectful thats my advice for you my name is when taylor swift saw one of the security he was about to remove a fan for getting a little too excited she managed to

him on the streets flirting with some fans and started recording and the weekend called him out for it and his reaction is priceless yeah thank you so much congratulations congratulations being famous is the dream of many but for toby maguire in the early s it was a nightmare when he couldnt leave his apartment building without a swarm of paparazzi recording him wait i cant i cant leave there are cars there get out of the way during a romantic dinner in cairns france brad pitt was justifiably annoyed when he spotted peoples recording from a distance when jenna ortega was asked to dance at the golden globes she simply was not having it choreographed the wednesday dance that went viral right yes i did can you show me real quick you was just like you was like during an interview with billy eilish the interviewers were kind of mocking her level of education which made her visibly frustrated the things that i need to do in my life dont have to do with but thats what i should be surprised how much biology still comes up in my radio career every day im like whats an element i mean this comes up all i dont have a radio career you graduated yes you might as well be graduated from college too then while youre at it i mean if youre just making stuff up yeah i mean exactly in fact she went to seton hall she graduated seton hall congratulations billy eilish billy do you know anything about anything during the world cup quarterfinals of argentina versus the netherlands there was a lot of tension in the match with a record yellow cards issued so after the game there was still some animosity which caused messi to lose his cool against a dutch player bueno and perhaps one of the most awkward interviews the host told megan fox that michael bay made her and she took it the wrong way and well everything went downhill from there michael they make you a nikon are you aware im not aware are you silly do you ever just look at yourself in the mirror and youre like i really did it today its not really about what you did but what he did what he did yeah sure thank god for michael bay despite mgks song sharing details about his personal life apparently hes a very private person and when he was asked about how it is being a father during an interview with billboard he sort of started spiraling and just walked out interview gift as a father to my daughter like heres something like you can listen to that like still has my pain in it so dont dont dont think that just because like im writing pop hits i dont want to pop you in the face like now i want to talk about this dude ive done this so many times dude can we just i dont want to do an interview man like i want to let my music speak from i dont have to say ive been saying for years dude like man how yall listen like listen my songs zendaya definitely did not appreciate the people next to her being loud at a fashion show an interviewer made selena gomez feel like a product and not a person when she didnt really care to listen to the answer she gave all slows down for me im probably going to devote most of my life to philanthropy okay thats good for me wow thank you shes asking me questions like good ones and then she didnt even pay attention to what i was saying seven years ago justin bieber was doing media for his upcoming tour in europe and he had to do an interview with a popular radio show in spain but upon arrival it was not hard to tell that justin bieber was not feeling it so when he was told that he was going to meet the biggest youtubers in spain that had a combined following of over million followers he took the moment to dip she had the biggest youtubers in europe they stood they got loud right after drake showed a picture of a girl that got his name tattooed on her forehead he kinda went on a tangent and started roasting the tattoo artist really incredible i dont know if you could see it but this girl tattooed drake on her forehead the guy who tatted it is a though i will tell you that i dont with that guy you to that tat artist by the way because youre an for real and you should lose your job and you should never do tattoos again i dont even if i ever see him you up i really really like i want to talk to this girl and understand it all you know as the world watched their every move growing up kendall and kylie jenner realized that they really didnt need to go to school anymore and their grades were suffering from it but well kris jenner on the other hand was not having their attitude about school and quickly knit that conversation in the bud i dont know anything and it makes me feel so dumb for your manners okay and absolutely no homeschooling girls come on chop chop turn that off kendall and get to your homework okay considering kylie jenner is a billionaire now maybe they were right shortly after releasing the break your heart right back in the song ariana grande accused someone of cheating an interviewer was trying to get ariana to name the ex who did it and she did not like it in fact a lot of people are talking about it and then you said well yeah because people took my quote and made a headline out of it i know what yall do of course well you said it were not alone they twisted it though they twisted it though all right so that is not what i said in one of the most entertaining tv moments in history cardi b and asia davis were supposed to clear their beef on a sitdown interview with vh but things quickly escalated when cardi b threw her footwear at asia and chaos erupted on the positive side we got some of the most iconic memes minutes later sometimes trying to get deep with a celebrity simply doesnt go your way to dislike him this is not a therapy session when a news reporter was being a little too sarcastic wiz khalifa was not having it and just ended the interview right there how was it growing up in canada yeah you just wear a suit just to look like you know what youre talking about yeah but you dont know we kind of have the same style no not just dude off man its over even though olivia rodrigo somehow didnt lose their cool a reporter might have gone too far when she asked about her diet like a certain diet or a detox or anything oh no im like i dont know i just eat whatever i want all the time which is how its supposed to be back in gordon ramsay received some backlash after being a guest at the tonight show with jay leno with sophia vergara since he made some inappropriate comments towards sophia vergara and teased her about a traditional dessert from colombia and her sons name can you change that name um can i what no it sounds like a paint yeah um okay this is my interview yeah dont you worry about him some actors like to act but dont like the press aspect that comes with the job at the golden globes joaquin phoenix called out a journalist for asking the same questions he had been asked for the past six months and things got a little awkward in the process of getting into that mindset this is old news isnt this old news didnt i didnt know i feel like ive talked about this for six months selena gomez appeared to get heated with their security team after she was bombarded with fans running up to her when she attended beyonces renaissance tour in paris back in an interviewer had a very condescending attitude when talking to kanye west by almost not believing

devastating loss for the milwaukee bucks jonas and titacumbo got win that a reporter was planning on writing a not so nice piece about him and the team so during the after game presser he walked out

conference for a fight against jake paul my questions for nate nate im actually a boxer myself and ive been trying to get into this undercard um im just wondering if you think i could fight your brother nick if hes anything like you i think id be hmm not very respectful by the way youre just gonna walk around the streets or something you know my homeboy see you right now its not a secret that kim kardashian used to be the assistant for paris hilton and then became very popular during an interview with abc the reporter suggested that her time has passed and that kim overshadowed her which made paris walk out if you ever worry about your moment having passed you want to wrap up robert kiyosaki is the author of rich dad poor dad and has made a fortuneselling book sharing his financial knowledge and well some of the content in his books when it comes to money is a very controversial and when he was doing an interview with cavalaria com he was not happy with the host trying to talk

seasoned actor transitioned into professional boxing a sport he had been passionate about since his preteen years he enjoyed success as an amateur boxer boasting an impressive record of consecutive

appearance on the e entertainment show botched where her challenging journey unfolded as she grappled with the removal of cementlike substances injected into her face breasts and hips these

information after this and well help you set up the bakery yes you do baking and then you do pottery and then you you think i could help you with the pottery but unfortunately i cannot okay okay i just got that yeah item thats what i was joking about thats what i was jing music music welcome to the hollywood reporter actress roundtable we have a remarkable group of actresses with us here today lets dive in i guess show of hands who here has ever signed on for a role that you were really excited about and then gone home and thought what have i just done yeah zoe yeah i think more more often times than not um the series that im doing right now lioness which was a show that was very um dialogue heavy and i wanted to challenge myself and sort of like address my dyslexia and my anxiety by by taking on a character that really was um you know commanding with a lot of dialogue and the moment i said yes i went home and i looked at my partner and i was like i dont i dont think i can do this and then obviously the next day was just you know roll your sleeves up and and just you know create all the tools that you need to get there can what it was really nervewracking i dont think ive ever done that but i do remember the first film i made when i was it was the second film that i made but i was in every shot of it i remember going home after one nights shooting and lying in the bath and trying to plan how i would break into the british film institute which was making the film to seize the dailies and destroy them my love for you just really figuring it out i knew rathburn place which is the street in london i was figuring out therell be a night watchman what could i do to distract him i was really going down that line but why why i to see why i think to be honest i just didnt couldnt imagine that any film in which i was in every frame was going to be anything other than unbearable and i there was no you know and the first film i was in i wasnt in every frame and there were lots of other people and i was always interested in seeing their scenes play out i would go and watch them work but when youre in every shot uh yeah yeah its its its difficult to imagine i mean whenever i see a film that im in for the first few times i see it my face is kind of fuzzed out like on those police videos you know and then slowly like the third screening ill go oh yeah its you yeah does anybody relate to that i mean i i think the first few times watching it through its always a little bit of the dicting of what youve done what you could have done to then step back and be able to then really take in the whole let let go of your own ego attachment to what other people think where you can then really kind of embrace but even now can you watch yourself can you can myself i find it very hard hear myself i cant i cant watch i cant i dont like hearing myself i dont watch such a beautiful voice thats so interesting but do you feel that would you rather if you had a choice would you rather watch yourself silent or hear your voice i dont like either i really have trouble watching myself too i dont theres many films ive never seen theres things i dont i can never watch dailies i dont i dont enjoy watching myself theres films you havent seen yeah wow that must be very tantalizing arent you tempted no because i i dont know i think like you you know we all probably have more discomfort with the presentation of self as much i love the work i love the process i dont want to think about what i look or sound like or else i dont know if id be as free yeah exactly and um and then i think once its over i i do want an audience to connect but i dont i i theres nothing i can do yeah so do you feel the same way over the films that youve directed versus the ones that youve performed in no im better when im not in it yeah yeah yeah you can sort of separate and watch watch your work objectively right when you when you directed versus yeah yes zena what are you thinking as youre hearing this youve been quiet listening like im i just its so interesting cu like i said it um im such a fan off of everyone here so its so im just like im just taking it in and sometimes its hard to go oh i should speak too but cuz i want to ask a lot of questions but um but yeah you know i i find for me at least that i im a very uh selfconscious person like everything i do im very selfcritical and i find that being on a set is one of the few places that i like just dont judge myself wow and i can just like be super free cuz im like wait its not me like you know what i mean i wouldnt make that decision im not that im not like i can just exist in this person and i feel almost like while still very attached to them also detached to them so like i feel like i love when a when a directors like hey come here and just point something out and i dont mind watching myself cuz im like its not me you know what i mean its like this weird thing and i dont actually ever get weird about it until i go oh people are going to see this thats when like once its like time to promote something and actually like im like oh oh now im selfconscious about the work that i just made but up until this point i was like just in my little bubble of like creative freedom and its not until you realize like oh this wont belong to just me forever like the world will consume it at some point that you start kind that my head starts going so i like living in that little creative pocket beautiful thats a really beautiful way that youre that youre holding that i i think its a very um evolved place to be in actually thank yeah it is because i think it takes a lot to get past that part where we are able to not be selfconscious i think that that is a real gift i i just take that little gum too also but its also what youre youre speaking to is when you look at yourself on a monitor or even in the film eventually it isnt its not just not you its not yours because its the light its the makeup its the costume its the design i remember once years and years ago the second film when i was in every frame and i remember like in week thinking i want a little bit of praise where am i going to get it from but i was too proud to ask anybody for any so i thought i know what ill do ill ask the editor ill ask him which is his favorite shot in the movie so far because im in likely that i might get it and so i went to the editor and i said whats your favorite shot and he said oo thats really hard m theres that short and close up of you and then im thinking im in with a chance he finally said yeah i think i think i got it its this closeup of you in this moment i dont know how he did it wow and it was genus it like cured me in that moment i thought yeah hes right how did the cinematographer do that how did the cinematographer frame it and lighted correct not actually much to do with me at all so i never asked for any praise ever again like completely and thats what youre speaking to you look in the monitor and you go well done well done everybody and youre in there somewhere yeah but its not just you so its such a collective thing absolutely well you truly are like an amalgamation of like all these genius peoples ideas i mean thats what we were just talking about with with directing because i i would love to direct one day and and and youve been able to do it and in a beautiful way and i and and something that makes me so nervous is that and she was like but theres people to help you like theres these gorgeous team of people that we get to work with that create i think just as much as we do the characters that we play so yeah ie yeah mikey when i think about having a lack of selfconsciousness on set i think about the opening scenes in anora where youre youre in this nightclub and as i understand it in the script there was not a lot of direction for you right you were just told to go up and approach customers potential customers can you talk a little bit about what that was like yeah so all of that is improvised sean created an entirely live set so theres music blasting a djs playing theres my coworkers all over the club men everywhere um and sean shot it on a long lens so he was in the corner of the club and he would just follow me around picking up men talking to people talking to my coworkers uh trying to get guys to come to the back room and get a dance with me so um so we just thought shot minutes straight of of that and then whittel it down to a couple minutes of the film which is the introduction into annie and who she is its a great in inc a wonderful and thats exactly what we get is that absolute youre so entrenched youre so embedded in the world of it you dont for a second not believe that its really wonderful youre doing the abs you should be very proud talking with the consultants was was the most important part of the preparation i think its just understanding how psychological of a job it is to be a sex worker its not only physically demanding but its mentally demanding as well because youre having to walk up to someone and immediately try to connect with them try to in that moment understand what it is you can offer them what kind of connection you guys can have together and its this instant like very intimate uh setting that youre in and so i think it can be quite draining mentally and then physically as well youre on your feet all day uh dancing in these really tall stilettos and so i think is just understanding the stamina that comes with that kind of profession being able to get to know the sex work community has been one of the most impactful things thats ever happened to me because these people are just incredible and i have so much respect for for what they do and i think that the film would be completely different and annie would have been a completely different character if i hadnt have done any of that preparation did you have a different idea of who they were before you had a chance to really get to know them as people i think i went into my research like very naively i honestly knew very little about sex work and what that was like and i had never been to a strip club before so i i knew i needed to dedicate a lot of time to that but i i was just able to get to know these women as people like just woman to woman and i ive made a lot of incredible friends yeah zoe it was so fun to watch you dance and million by the way thank you what was it like to get back to dance which is really how you began in this industry it was i felt like it was a true gift i was given the opportunity to reconnect with parts of me that unconsciously i just left behind and um and i was yearning i was just yearning and missing them a lot as in new york or you know ive been saying this a couple of times youre born with jazz hands and and then you you you spent like your whole life un jazzing your hands because at any moment youre like but you when you grow up in new york um you know if your grandmother saves some money then shell buy some raffle tickets you know some tickets and then shell take you to the theater or you youll go to lincoln center and i remember being a child and walking by lincoln center and she would go look look look while she was like smoking her cigarette like one day one day youre going to be there and i remember thinking like what is she saying and then its its very beautiful when things come full circle but i do believe that you do have to find a way to manifest them h do you think you manifested this some i did i did um by really wanting it i think that um after a certain while you at least for myself i i i just i fell into this pattern of going being an autopilot constantly and i was a part of really successful films that became franchises and i have no regrets they gave me so much i i worked with amazing people um but theyre very time consuming and this is all happening wild stuff im starting a family so that desire to to grow to sort of shatter whatever glass ceiling i felt like i was falling under um was growing more and more you know as the years went by and um and i just i wrote a list a couple of years before booking amelia betes i wrote a list with my team and i said well these are the top five directors that i would love to work with and like i think that jack was in the top three he was always somebody that i i loved and i love the fact that jack challenges me to question whether or not you know i have enough humanity when i look at people you know who do who do we consider redeemable and amelia b was this story with four women that are not perfect um they are damaged theyre theyre products and they victims of their environment but theyre making their own decisions and theyre on a quest for the most for their most most authentic freedom i loved the fact that in the end its a very simple story and its just peppered with all this complexity of their environment and their choices and you start out in the movie and you look at you look at you know rita youre like well if youre a lawyer you know you damn well whats the difference between right and wrong why are you defending this criminal and why are you going with myas and why are you doing all these things and and but you cant really look at a woman or a person this way its what what is what what does she want she deserves to want something she wants power she wants success she wants beauty she wants money and and thats great so once i once i inhabited sort of that that body of hers um there was nothing was going to stand in my way it was it was quite exciting to be in rs world knowing that the unthinkable was about to happen she was going to get this opportunity to break free from these chains and she was never going to look back and and sing and d and sing that was that was like the icing on the cake yes yes yes it was it was amazing and and um the rehearsals were grueling and i welcomed it every single day i wasnt dancing rita wasnt dancing rita was exploring and r is thinking and feeling so those breaths of of song and dance were just her thoughts and her emotions so once i i i think about it from that sort of perspective um i just needed to know that all those moves were going to be in my body so that i would not be limited by them because they were not dance moves they were just expressions expressions exactly and be able to blend um so many parts of me spanish is my first language and its the its the language that i was sung to for the first time all the lullab thats how my mother healed me she made me she cooked for me loves me like in in her in my language and and as as i grew older i felt like an impostor living double like a double agent where and you know behind closed doors this is who i am and and outside this is this is this other person because i am american but i felt like my craft was really um not getting the best of me because i dont know theres something really beautiful about being able to incorporate so many parts of you and what you do that um makes it a much more thrilling experience you know to go through and a much more passionate process for me so it was it was a great gift had you made other films in spanish before i mean i ive said a couple of lines here and there but never aladina you know must how was it also them working with the director who essentially speaks fren it was amazing theres something really beautiful about jack this is not the first film that he does in a different language of his own hes not limited by language and it wasnt you know this set wasnt only a spanish and a french set there was there was a lot of english there was a lot of italian there was a lot of any language that we needed to be able to communicate but you know when youre synced with people its a language is just you know one more tool m so that uh it was it was a beautiful process angelina when we talk about singing as a tool you spent months learning to sing like maria callus what did you learn about yourself in that process oh so much im im so happy to be here at this table to to talk to all of you its so nice shes shes an artist it was the first time id played an artist and so to have this discussion has been interesting because so much and your connection to your body to your music is so exciting to see you do so many things that you know hadnt yet seen you do on screen and very exciting as a fan to to see that um i was really frightened because its something id never done and i had someone in my life uh say that i couldnt sing you know and you have someone it could be anybody but just someone and it could be a passing and and somehow it had this effect i i i i didnt realize how much that had blocked me me and also i didnt realize how much and i think singing or not just as women and performers id lost my voice i didnt know my voice i think i didnt understand how much life changes your voice whether it be childbirth or death or someone you love or sickness or whatever it may be but we hold things in our body we we we change the way we are and somewhere along the way years old somewhere along the way i lost my voice so it was such a gift to have these seven months to have someone hold my hand and help me take a deep breath and try to make sound again and i didnt realize i could sing and i didnt know i was a soprano which made no sense to me cuz im i dont think i have that voice um and to discover opera which is such a beautiful art form and one that i felt somehow wasnt for me i dont know why i think its theres certain things that maybe we think i didnt whether its its a language right that this is a a language that isnt for me its people who are raised here or more familiar with this or its very sophisticated or very you know and and so i felt like i was able to learn about this world and make sounds in a different way and and use my body and my voice in a different way and if you havent tried to sing opera i recommend it to everyone because its the only thing ive ever done where you you have your full physical body your full vocal and your full emotion and we especially as women are very rarely allowed asked encouraged to give that to use our own voice with everything we well our full power all of it all of it all of it with everything weve got and not feel we are adjusting to the room to our children to man to society to right something along the way forms us and we dont bust out with everything yes that we are especially so i felt like it was a gift as you said and and maria callis is one of us shes yes she was a woman and spent a lot of time in her process alone which is why this is so lovely sitting here and realizing thinking of her and being she didnt have this table right um a lot of women in the p didnt have this table right there werent as many women doing certain things and they didnt have community in this way and so important that you know i was also surprised i got here today so many of us have been aware of each other weve never met its quite strange you know really were we dont have many opportunities to just actually connect in the form of community and really you know just even reflect as artist or experience or process it is a bit of an it can be lets say a bit of an isolating experience can you are encouraged to be isolated right i feel i feel like it used to be that that notion that you needed to always stay super hyperfocused on your journey and and um and not seek support right or not not lend support and i feel like its its the most important thing but its such a mirage because exactly its not real i mean we all know how important are women friends are to us its its everything and theres a sort of strange trapdoor in society that people kind of slip through and theyre not aware of it i mean men so true give the impression that theyre not aware of it they also give the impression that they dont have the same kind of you know collective feel together thats their affair and they have to figure it out if its true its probably not true but at least there is a strange kind of myth around it but this is a beautiful table is a beautiful moment i mean you know the glamour at this table except for me is you are incredibly glamorous but lets imagine that seriously that this is you know this must be encouraged to just see it and shoot the breeze as women and and and acknowledge and also this whole idea that women dont make movies i mean as we all know women have been making films as directors and i dont just mean as performers since the very beginning of cinema editors lois babber was the very first director in or something the the and its thats the reality but theres a strange sort of mesmerism around it its were all supposed to forget it and also were all supposed to be pitched against each other thats the thing is that it isnt a competition and thats been the illusion that somehow thats been bought into versus this idea that when one rises we all rise and that when we walk the path not alone we also expand exponentially yeah its so important but i think its something my sense is to generalize that its the collective kind of view is something that comes so naturally to women more naturally the whole idea that theres only room for one may suit men better or the society of men better but i dont think it suits women i think we know how to do this this is what we do yes you know we sit around tables and we chat and we support each other and we witness each other absolutely to me the substance is so much about the way womens bodies are criticized the way we criticize our own bodies what was it that drew you to that theme i mean first of all the script was such an interesting outof thebox read like something id never read before um and the way in which it was exploring the issue of aging and while the circum stances were said in hollywood it was an actress which i think just heightened and and kind of grounded it in something that everyone could identify with the thing that really grabbed me was the exploration of the violence we can have against ourselves its that way in which we can dissect and criticize and that i have found at least in my own experience in life that its really not what anyone else has ever done to me the the the impact is always has been on what i do to myself internalized there was that powerful scene the going out scene oh my lord j it just it spoke it it was such an intimate and and just raw transparent you know portrayal of what we can do to ourselves how we commit self harm on a daily basis sometimes without even touching our bodies we can just be so like you dont youre not worthy of going out and the removal of the makeup and and even the way that you were looking at yourself with so much you were so you were so selfcritical you know and i just i felt it and it was so powerful thank you im so grateful she came to you im so grateful that was a good idea i mean am i mean it was really definitely um i think the other thing as an actor that ive never explored is i didnt really have other people that all of my scenes were almost all alone and i had no dialogue so everything was in that kind of odd intimate moments we have with oursel where we are often naked looking dissecting thinking um and it was a really interesting challenge to step in and really create a full life for her at all times so that it was alive always because i didnt have someone else to kind of feed off of so it was and and it was also very technical so there a lot of times the technical aspects which youve done a lot where theres the technical sometimes takes priority over the sensitivity of an actors process right or that she sometimes like to start this close instead of a little wider to find it but it was um but that was really it i think that it was so relatable in a way that felt like it was an important message that needed to come across for us to all start to reevaluate how were holding ourselves how that that need of greater gentility um you know its a um ive had obviously a lot of conversations having three daughters and one of the things that my middle daughter said at one point is she says i want to quit wasting time focusing on all that im not when i could be celebrating all that i am beautiful beautiful and that first of all i said maybe ive done a good job but also that that is it that is that is that is it that makes me want to know so if we do this to ourselves how do we break out of it because its ultimately about selfacceptance its about really looking and appreciating who we are as we are right now where and that involves changing like how we change we evolve and it isnt the same reflection in the mirror and i think its that idea is what i trade having you know as one woman said shes just more loosely wrapped what i would i trade being more tightly wrapped for the wisdom that ive g gained and who ive become as a woman today right i dont think i would and and at the same time appreciating all of the different parts of me that have brought me to where i am today its like embracing the shadow sides the sides that you know when we can look at our triumphs that have come through our obstacles our challenges our failures we can see them not as a failure but as an opportunity for growth in a win mhh zanda we have become as an audience used to seeing you play a kid used to seeing you play a teenager um and challengers for a good portion of the movie youre a grown woman yeah what was that like um you know its uh it was its kind of like the scary step in a persons career where you go from like for so long i feel like i was playing a teenager pretty much way past where i when i was one and um i and i appreciated that so much i mean being able to play r has been one of the greatest gifts of my life but um there comes a time where you got to start playing your own age and beyond and um you know it was a scary thing and also you know challengers too it was kind of like my first time in like a a leading lady role and and and kind of taking that responsibility as well and um and and and being a part of the prod producing you know aspect as well it was all um very exciting and also very like daunting you know um but i think for me i think i think when you read certain characters youre like i just cant pass the opportunity to play this woman like i she just was refreshing to me in her uh unapologetic nature you know she doesnt apologize for you know her behavior which i i appreciate it in in this way and um her sense of control um or her need for control as her life is kind of falling apart and her vicariously to live through other people and i think it it spoke to me because i love my job so much im so grateful that i get to do this for a living and i think like what if it was all taken away and for her her her true love was tennis that was like thats all she ever wanted and it and and there you know thankfully i get to do this for as long as i really want to um but an athlete you know you only have limited amount of time until your body doesnt do what it used to do and um i think an injury is like when it gets snatched you cant reverse that and it gets snatched from her so quickly and i um and she in her own way loses her voice you know its like she doesnt know who she is anymore without this thing and i think thats something that in my own life i was understanding as a young woman coming into the thing like ive been working since i was a kid and i was like wait who am i when im not working like do i have a life what what do i even like to do like what are my hobbies what what what are my interest like who is zindaa outside of this and so i just deeply related to that idea of like desperately wanting to hold on to this love and this thing and um and in her it manifested in maybe some more toxic um actions ill say but not to judge her because i know where its coming from you know its coming from a place of truly vulnerability like i remember one of our first conversation was like what kind of like cream does she use before bed you know what i mean like what what is her like what what is like being this this woman or this pres presentation is so important to her how people see her how people view her um how she comes off to other people and so shes got to have the best stuff and its you know its silk to bed and its you know all these things and then you see it kind of unraveling and falling apart and shes just trying to hold everything together like hold this this this uh this ideal um so yeah i just uh it was nice to explore a character who like i said is unapologetic and while she makes very different decisions than i would personally um it it was it was there was a freedom there um and being guided by luca in that way as well and again back to the amalgamation of everybody sayu whos incredible and made it look gorgeous and um our costume uh jonathan anderson did the costumes which was amazing to kind of see his artistry come out through that and um felt very like supported um in this kind of becoming a woman on on camera you know and one thing that was really powerful in in your character that i resonated with me and and um its emotions that we suppress that we never like to admit that we feel your character felt so much jealousy that these men that in her in her mind were so undeserving of this gift of this talent and i i it was it was just amazing to see that to see a woman be equal to a man when it came when it comes to aptitude when it comes to talents when it comes to wit and all of these things and and her competition werent other women it was the partners in her life it was it was quite interesting her her boys um yeah well i appreciate that and i you know um again it was exploring parts of uh a life that i havent lived yet having kids or being getting married and you know these kinds of things shes already had this part of her life so it it was i was strange to kind of embody that part of myself that hasnt quite existed yet you know um but i guess that that is my job but but it was you know its a different touch point you know its a different um part of yourself that hasnt quite been explored yet but yeah i just i dont know i appreciated that she just said whatever the hell she wanted to say and i was like girl maybe we should stop slapping people you know what i mean and then getting a little crazy but um i mean shes entirely herself and and i and i appreciate that um both justin who who who wrote wrote the uh screenplay and and luca allowed her to be um exactly who she was it was never trying to like explain why she was like this she just likeed this she was like this when she was younger you know its like it it wasnt necessarily the injury that made her this way she just is this way um and i just appreciated being able to explore that it was unapologetic alo in her ambition and her drive which is what i loved me too and and that when there was that because what was so beautiful was the subtlety of the grief that i felt you held underneath and then just activating it into like chant you channeled it over into their success youre saying you said it beautifully but also i think to back to like a bigger conversation of this idea of like not ever being able or allowing uh women in the space to like to grieve or to have a moment to yourself i think shes so conditioned to be like next like theres no time to like feel sorry for yourself theres no time to like too grieve too you know and she just immediately pivots and shes like okay new plan and i think that that is that thing of like allowing ourselves moments like be a person and we dont have to hold it all together we dont have to like our humanness yeah be respons its about a relationship with success the whole idea of success being the holy grail that youre going for whatever that means i mean for a for a sports person it means something very very clear yeah and that everything else takes second or third or fourth place and where does the living happen yeah well its also that question of identity like who am i without because who what we do isnt actually who we are its just

ambassadors ins saying and not specifying what it is its just as vague as can be like i said i theyll go to foreign countries that ask for money or get their project thats what theyre talking about yeah like you said you might as well just go to burger king and get them a crown and call them king of hollywood again we want to bring back the golden age of hollywood just like the we want to make america great again or we want to take it back to the good old days first of all this is extremely vague they havent said what kind of they said i listen if they if theyre saying some other things i dont think its going to get done with the with the other part of this the actual business part of what theyre saying we have yet to see how how thats going to work out talk about that in a minute but this other thing that theyre talking about taking this back to the golden age of hollywood again thats that thats thats not thats not a statement that applies to everybody because the golden age for some people was not so golden for others the the the the good old days was somebodys very bad day and this whole thing about make america great again again we question okay what we talking about make america great again for who you know people we just got through celebrating black panther not too long ago you know that was that was what uh uh something like that yall know how it took almost a century to get to where we sure sure well itll take us back to where therell be plenty of acting roles for black people like may and drug dealers oh yeah pimps yeah people its you know thats you know back in the golden age of hollywood yeah people would not have a voice people did not have themselves represented people did not see themselves in certain positions and certain roles you know so i dont i dont thats what anybody say we gonna take it back to the blah blah days i dont want to hear that cuz that was never for everybody no no and they cant cuz people dont really want to there not people want to see that they will serve as special envoys to me for the purpose purpose of bringing hollywood which has lost much business over the last four years to foreign countries back bigger better and stronger than let me tell you something the last four years did you forget that moment where china was kind of dictating how we did things did yall forget that period we were just talking about this the other yall forget that period where china was telling us hey listen you got to have a chinese person here its got to be released in our market if you want to make money you know this is this is way before the last four years yeah might want to hear that getting people this is again you know hes going to put these lies out here and people just going to eat this up no matter what its propaganda yeah pure and simple i can tell you what if john voy going over there looking for money we they gonna send his ass right back emptyhanded let him go there talking that crazy i went to china and uh they everything went good i sold them hollywood yeah let mel gibson go there ask for money i know your jews got some let him go go let him go there ask for some money china hes like a these cheap cheap ass japs they dont want to buy anything hey you goddamn yellow bastards give me some money h com there shooting the guns yeah let him go ask for money i dont know man i listen this aint going this i i they cant even describe what how theyre going to do this its just its just headlines cant describe how they going to do it they cant describe the role definitely they cant describe how they going the first ordered business fan of this i mean so this is going to be you might as well hire mary larry m curlyy up actual three stents yeah yeah i dont i i dont get it man they spread out you too the only one i think could probably pull something off is sylvester stallone but you know i gu said but the thing is like you said these guys aint open up no big movies lately no no you know has a tv series yeah yeah in oklahoma he put his ass just like he plays a mafia guy that they sent to oklahoma thats hollywood sending his ass to oklahoma he lives in florida i think its sylvester lo lives in florida what the you you dont even live in hollywood anymore how the you gonna do whatever whatever dont make any sense
bAi40JYKU4A,hollywood is fcked now,i dont think that a lot of this is going to go public with p diddy because a lot of the people you truth is that theyre underage right and so theyre not going to have a trial about like you know underage sex crimes that go public but man its looking real weird since dids arrest in september many celebrities have been suspiciously quiet diddy was connected with almost everyone in the hollywood elite and the music industry almost every celebrity had met him at some point and many had gone even further joining his parties and perhaps even his crimes in this day and age silence is celebritys greatest enemy and unfortunately many of them are learning this the hard way take for example lebron james love him or hat him aint no party like a diddy party man he should not have said that why did you say that theres no reason you had to say that is undeniably one of the biggest games in the nba holding four championships under his belts being compared to michael jordan as the goat and being declared an nba allstar years in a row cenus mantle is the top of basketball but unfortunately he has been involved in some rumors lately and it all happened with a single comment during one of diddys live streams years ago the nba star made a quick appearance and declared everybody know aint no party like a diddy party hey everybody know aint no party like a diddy party so yeah thats up at the time no one thought much of the exchange all it was was a pair of celebrities each other and lebron had no idea how damning those words would be nor how quickly his fellow athletes would turn on him because of them during the buildup to a fight against waim buckley kobe kington made some scathing comments about lebron at the time lebron james had suddenly stepped down from his team i think to to say that lebron james was in on it or knew about it is kind of unfair and im sure p didy did have parties and he did have people at parties that may have been uh present when weird and bad things were happening but he might not they might not have necessarily known about it like i remember ive been at parties before and uh like there was like one time people were like doing drugs and i i didnt even know that like i was somewhere else i wasnt paying attention but i found out like later on somebody was doing drugs there sure i just dont know personal reasons this seemed to come out of nowhere he was also taking a break from social media at the same time it might have been a coincidence especially since the was nuring a foot injury but other people didnt think so any other time people would never have blinked tonight this hes at the top of his game maybe he just needs a break however lebrons break began shortly after a clip of the live stream with him and diddy started making the rounds and the whole thing just seemed too fishy and covington held no punches during the press conference the ufc fighter deem james as a scumbag for his past comments and starts on certain political issues and then he went on to voice his confusion about why people thought of him as a role model and finished by telling the nba player that he hoped he got locked up in the same cell as diddy jesus christ yeah he wants to defund the police the most patriotic people in america yeah i do think that if i ever hear somebody saying they want to defund the police i immediately take everything that they say much less seriously i i wish that we could have a person like i if trump could do a thing where anybody who is in favor of defunding the police i would be willing to pay more taxes to pay for a oneway trip for them to live in a country with no police i think that would be perfect total problem solved you dont like the police okay go over there it was a very intense speech for send mma followed it with an interview a few days later during the interview comington commented on how odd jamess radio silence was and demanded to know where hed actually gone tell you guys the other day at media day now all of a sudden hes went radio silent hes taking an indefinite leave and hes nowhere to be found so whered you go lebron whyd you leave you have something to hide and hes not the only celebrity whos called out lebron james for the live stream comments sean strickland also shared his thoughts on the matter on x he shares his thoughts on every matter he talks about yeah this guy yeah hes talking about all the time where he would deem lebron james is spineless mocking him forever attending diddys parties closing off with an also unflattering comment i bet him and machine gun kelly were puffs bottom oh my god lebron jamess role in those parties other people have tried to defend lebron james who insisted that people wait until the law has decided on the matter but speculations are impossible to stop and while nothing has been confirmed lebron james lack of response to the accusations really hasnt helped his case and the fact that he suddenly left the spotlight raises peoples suspicions even more as most people felt that this break came way too soon straight after the diddy allegations to be a coincidence as one other reason would he have to avoid social media than bad press but for now people are iring on the side of caution but le i think also for man yeah um anyway uh i i think also the reason is because lebron shared a lot of political views that people disagreed with so now people have more of a reason to go even harder that hes like not talking about it so like theres like a secondary reason for it as well definitely isnt the only celebrity catching strays from diddys case as jayz has also felt the consequences of his choice of friends when he received his own b of accusations in october amid the numerous allegations against diddy one stood out amongst the rest a young girl who was sexually assaulted by a trio of celebrities the initial suit only listed diddy referring to the other two perpetrators as celebrity a male and celebrity b female who do you think they were guys who who do you guys think it was however after an attempt to keep things anonymous the defendant amended the suit on the th of december jayz was the first celebrity linked to dds alleged illegal activities according to the allegations filed the now yearold jane doe was determined to get into the vmas so that would be if shes that would be years ago wow thousand was on her bucket list and while she didnt have a ticket she was sure shed find another way to get in so a friend dropped her off at a radio city music hall where the vmas were being hosted she began her search while there were no celebrities around to talk to she could ask their limo drivers about getting in one of those drivers claimed to work for diddy he couldnt get her into the awards but he did invite her to an afterparty according to the allegation he said that the rap so she got invited to a hollywood afterparty at years old huh okay po light younger girls and she f what he was looking for he explained that he needed to drop diddy and others off first but if she can meet him after the vmas he could get her to the after party being young and naive to the dangers of the invitation the young go agreed and after a minute drive she arrived at a white house with a ushaped driveway a lots of people ask me how to bring their

below and use my code moon to get twice the number of ai minutes in your first month wow apparently upon entering two men asked her to sign what she now believes was an ind she was then met by a site that would have shocked any yearold i dont know why you would even do that i mean if a crime was committed then uh you know you cant have an nda protect you but who knows inside was a party resembling the movie eyes wi shut a huge party of celebrities some of which she recognized and tried to mingle with allegedly all of them were drinking and participating weight staff cired the crowd while loud music boomed through the room while attempting to socialize the young girl took one of the offer drinks it was reddish yellow and tasted like orange juice cramberry juice and something bitter after a few sips she felt lightheaded and went looking for a place to light down and that bit of taste have been ghb a party drug known for causing drowsiness and often used to spike people according to the allegation people theres something this happens all the time like uh it happened at twitchcon apparently its believed that diddy or his employees at his instruction were adding the drug to the guests drinks she found a room that was empty of everything besides a large bed and planned to rest there for a while but unfortunately things quickly went from bad to worse when the accused tree of celebrities stumbled into the room according to her allegation diddy had a craz look in his eyes he approached her aggressively claimed that she was ready to party and threw her towards a wall while she was able to get up again diddy grabbed her once more and threw her onto the bed at that point she was getting more and more disorientated which the trio took advantage of allegedly celebrity a removed her clothes and raped her while diddy and the female celebrity watched once finished he stepped back against the wall and diddy took his place and the two others still watching when the rapper knocked her down intending to continue the young girl started to fight back and after a bit of a struggle she landed a punch to diddys neck that caused him to stop she stood up gra her clothes and shoes and ran out of the roo her dress covering her like a towel not entirely free she then ran around the house until she found the front door once outside you telling me did he got his ass beat by a yearold girl no sh this is no way like theres like i dont know if i believe this man like this is wild this is wild man like its believe its no no no i mean like im not saying it what do i always say extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence this is an extraordinary claim lets be reasonable here r nearby gas station fortunately for the young girl a female cler saw that she was in distress and allowed her to use the phone she called a dad admitted she had lied about where she was and was soon picked up after the alleged incident the young girl fell into a deep depression apparently she now suffers from ptsd and a seizure disorder caused by the stress and trauma you can only imagine how traumatizing this would be she also claims to have difficulty with relationships and functioning in society following all of this both men were very quick to deny these allegations didy lawyers deem the suit a shameless publicity stunt to get money out of him the rappers issue was that he already had a check in past outside of his friendship with diddy he was friends with predators like ary even after it came out that he married a minor and was often rumored to be dating miners himself however the dodgiest thing about him is his relationship with beyonce during a interview with beyonce explained that shed be in no rush to get married when she started dating the rapper in fact shed sworn off getting married until she turned okay the logic behind her decision was quite sound as she told i really dont believe that you will love the same thing when youre as you do at she wanted to discover who she was before sharing it with the man she planned to spend the rest of her life with however as sweet as that sent is beyonce was still dating jayz throughout the years before they got married its possible that she looked at him for guidance as she learned to navigate the music industry and certain aspects of ad life but this doesnt seem very good for several reasons firstly because of how long theyve been together jayz sets his wife standard for what to expect from a partner this means that even in situations where another woman might have left such as her partner cheating on her multiple times beyonce stayed because it was the kind of behavior shed come to expect this also implies that the rapper could shape impossible to know whether this happened this is all super conjecture thanks for the subs man appreciate it the woman he wanted something she confirmed during a speech he made before they were married you taught me so many things i was to many years old press i g you taught me how to be a woman taught me so many things i was years old press up she say she said right i we taught me how to be a woman taught me how to rel you taught me how to be a friend um youve given me so much in life many seem to think that jayz had successfully molded her into something for him she wasnt her own woman but rather a product of his fantasies and i think this is all i think this is all i do i i think this entire narrative like i i ive ive heard tons of speeches like this uh of like you know a man saying this about a woman or vice versa i i dont think this really means a whole lot yeah theres no proof yeah yeah i i just im not really grooming shes years old she she a grown ass woman shes years old its not grooming thats whenever you you get involved with a kid that he wasnt willing to share no mat in the other persons intentions which brings us to the third and final point about jayz his alleged possessive there have been several situations where beyonce wasnt allowed to perform directly with any male artist besides jayz this i dont think this is that big of a thing i really dont like even with streamers ive ive heard of probably more than half a dozen situations like this with streamers some private some not ninja is a public one yeah this is very commonly people feel this way its extreme extremely common its insecure about as but thats it yeah yeah i mean i dont think you can really look at this and like draw the line from like this to being like a molester thats totally different makes collaboration between art is difficult something that sha po and bum b experienced firsthand after working on baby boy with beyonce in shin po only ever performed it with her three times while po denied that jayz had anything to do with this many believed other wise there were just too many odd situations surrounding their few performances such as when as mik cut off in the jamaican artist eventually revealed that jayz was never comfortable with his wife being around him his interference in bums collaboration with his wife on check on it was slightly more direct during an interview bumbi revealed that jayz called and instructed all the men to leave the set during the video shoot after so many years of dodginess histar just felt longwinded and almost manipulative especially his comments about the heartbreak he felt for his family and the declaration that he was being black m felt like a reached to many people things got even worse for the rapper when busby revealed that what jayz called extortion was just standard practice according to the oh wow who gives a yeah i really okay hes a jealous guy i know so many guys that are jealous guys i i i i dont like this doesnt its just like so in my opinion irrelevant like as i said i ive dealt with like this streaming stuff for years and like so if its like this with streaming even you can imagine its probably this way like x x in like his position if not more so yeah jealousy isnt illegal insecurity isnt illegal yeah lawyer jane do had only been seeking mediation contrary to the rappid statement shed never demanded a penny from him in turn they were bullied harassed and even sued and it wasnt just busby who was first being harassed either according to an instagram post jayzs team is harrassing his children colleagues and employees furthermore they are trying to dig up dirtt on busby and get former clients to sue him and when they cant find the dirt they want theyre making up something new and telling it to anyone who will listen in a last stitch effort to make things go his way the rapper filed a motion to dismiss the case when doing so he was revealed that he was the one who had sued busbys fm for extortion proving some of the lawyers previous claims jayz seems to have convinced himself that j do is a suent in busby is using to extort him for money as such part of his suit includes the public disclosure of jane dos identity most people completely dismissed him believing he was nothing more than a celebrity desperate not to pay their dues however something happened recently that might have changed the situation drastically as some of the information his accuser gave was inaccurate according to the initial report jane do had spoken to benji madden however madden revealed that he wasnt in new york at the time of the incident furthermore diddy and jayz were photographed at a nightclub that evening while the photos dont account for the whole evening they invite some doubt into the accusers claims however the most damning bit of evidence against story is that her father doesnt remember being cool to pick her up this would have been an i dont know like i im going to be i dont believe it i think shes lying thats three lies theres a reasonable doubt yeah the no father would forget that yeah you think a father is going to forget that that happened that like what are we talking about yeah i i what no way no way extremely traumatic experience especially for someone so young any normal father would probably end up in jail after learning that their child had been raped so why the do had a father who didnt care what happened to her or her story wasnt entirely true now these inconsistencies dont me mean her claims are necessarily fce however all women i dont believe all women theres plenty of women that lie believe all women get the out of here believe the truth theres plenty of girls that lie make up its not the majority the majority dont lie but some do trust the rap out now and it does seem like the case is turning in his favor diddys a list of friends are undoubtedly being hit the though is like there its this is the same thing with like bill cosby is that there were so many people it was like something people right and a few of them did get proven and so it makes the ones that didnt get proven easier to expect probably happened what i bet is that the people that do weird and bad stuff like this probably did it more than one or two times so i bet if these people are actually guilty im sure some of them did it once and they never did it again right im sure that happened but i think with many of the regular uh you know the usual suspects i i think that well figure it out remember the chick from duke who university who lied and then shes in jail now yeah i remember that and then they just like at the end of it theyre like yeah well she we dont need to worry about her being in jail because now shes in jail for murder its like wait what yeah taking accountability doesnt mean responsibility well i i think thats thats very different right people who do this have a history of doing it yeah so theres a very um un unfavorable but very popular uh statistic that i learned unfortunately whenever i had to look into this uh is that the people that end up getting in trouble for being sexual uh predators have had on average five victims before they actually get caught this time however then not the ear ons facing accusations even celebrities like cuba ging jr who were never close with diddy of being drawn into the destructive orbit in his case ging was once an incredibly successful actor who could claim ownership of an oscar however controversy soon found him too in cuba pleaded guilty to a miss him being a charge after forcibly kissing an employee of a nightclub in new york in he also admitted to two other instances of nonconsensual contact see thats my exact point right there theres almost never one point on the graph he went to counseling for his issues and for a few years the controversy stopped cuba started trying to make it come back after what seemed like a solid course correct however controversies continued to follow him and in early he was hit with even more allegations according to these allegations cuba was back to his old ways his victim a music producer named rodney jones the same rodney jones he fought just they cant stop bro they cant stop lawsuit against diddy in february now g never interacted with diddy publicly however it seems the two did know each other well enough for gooding to show his face on one of his yachts according to jones the rapper left him alone with gooding while aboard one of his yachts in the actor alle lally took advantage of the situation and groped jones until the producer pushed him away people were already wary of kuba because of his past but his response to the allegations put a sour taste in many peoples mouths as he laughed when asked about the accusation aint nobody calling cat williams crazy now that was really something wasnt it that was really something st it though like your name for example was mentioned in the diddy case which was the most ridiculous thing ever is the most ridiculous thing ever most people saw his words as a harless dismissal to them it almost seemed like he didnt fully understand the weight of the situation especially i i dont agree with that i dont think that he should take it seriously or act like its serious at all hes being accused of something with no evidence what wh why yeah get the yeah tell him get the out of here like no i had nothing to do with it thats it right i mean if that was me thats what i would say yeah just get the out of here looking at all of these actions in history that or he just didnt care some felt he was also hiding behind his faith to make it appear like he turned a new leaf but unfortunately there are way too many examples of celebrities especially this high up who were joining these horrific freak off parties that hide behind their religious faith for sympathy or to rebrand to them he wasnt being genuine just playing a part for another crack at fame and glory and to distance himself from diddy as a whole and while nothing has been proven people remain wary of him but as the diddy case continues to expose more and more celebrities itll be interesting to see how it further alters peoples people also have like a lingering resentment towards celebrities in general and i think thats caused them to celebrate uh the downfall of celebrities and like people that are in like these high places i think its like kind of the its its a branch from the same tree of like the like why people are like in favor of like luigi its its its part of that same tree and values of that and as we see more and more of whats actually happening in these parties and who were involved will be an interesting year to say the least i cannot wait i cannot wait because i i am actually one of the people i i think that a lot of them are weird and i feel like there are just so many weird things that have happened that i cant imagine its a its a coincidence you know ill link you guys the video yeah its just its too much man cleaning house yeah i know theres the video right there and uh yeah give it a like i i ill be very curious to see what happens with diddy i feel like hes probably like i i just hope that i hope they get the list of the other people right we live stream public trial i dont think its going to be a public trial to be honest with you but i will ill cover the topic yeah of course i will right hes going to get epsteined im going to be honest i really dont think thats going to happen i think the reason why its probably not going to happen is because of how many additional people there are that are involved like with epstein like you have to keep in mind like if you think about like obviously like these celebrities are like really powerful right theyre extreme like p did is extremely power but like the measure of magnitude between p diddy and bill clinton is a bigger measure of magnitude between you and p diddy it it its not even in the same universe so yeah i i i feel like this probably not going to happen need the batman yeah yeah p diddy is a billionaire though yeah but were talking about bill clinton here okay like this yeah who gives him power right yeah lets lets be real here and uh i mean they blew other celebrities up maybe thats going to happen i just dont think thats going to be it yeah what about prince andrew oh im not sure about that the power roll is different yeah its very different and eps billionaire finance year yeah and uh bills owned by billionaires um yeah i dont ive always been of the mindset money is not power power is power and uh i i think that if youre a former president and youve got like private islands you have this massive amount of power like that is like insurmountable like thats on a totally different level like thats real power right not like oh ive got a lot of money and maybe i can bribe people like it its yeah its a totally different universe
RUEJ_lNouss,the real reason hollywood cant say sorry to god,why its hard for hollywood to say sorry to god hollywood the land of fame fortune and endless storytelling but behind the glitz and glamour lies a surprising truth this industry known for producing blockbusters about redemption and forgiveness struggles to say the simplest prayer sorry god why today were diving into the deep reasons behind hollywoods tension with the divine spoiler alert its about more than just religion stay tuned because this story will make you see the entertainment world in a whole new light imagine this the most glamorous stage in the world filled with the biggest stars glittering dresses flashing cameras and then mockery hollywood takes center stage to ridicule f faith make fun of god and push the boundaries of reverence but what happens next no one saw it coming welcome to the nd golden globes the night when hollywood shines brightest yet something dark lurks in the shadows as the stars celebrate their achievements one name is conspicuously absent from their lists of gratitude god hours of glamour laughter and applause pass by yet the creator of the universe receives no mentions mocking god its nothing new for hollywood theyve done it time and time again but just hours later something happened that left everyone speechless hollywood has a long history of pushing the envelope whether its late night jokes or outrageous speeches some stars seem to delight in mocking god and faith remember the time an alist actor said id like to thank myself because i did all the work the room erupted in laughter but it left a bitter taste for millions watching but why does hollywood have such a lovehate relationship with faith is it just for laughs or is there something deeper going on many have warned that mocking god isnt just offensive its dangerous the bible tells us in galatians do not be deceived god is not mocked for whatever one sws that will he also reap so could these moments on stage be sewing seeds of trouble could hollywoods disregard for reverence have unintended consequences some believe the answer is yes and what happened next might proved them right there was a time when faith and film walked hand in hand classics like the ten commandments and benur were not only box office hits they were cultural phenomena studios openly embraced stories of faith recognizing their power to inspire but something shifted today spiritual themes are often controversial and some say hollywood has turned its back on god but heres the thing admitting fault requires humility and in an industry built on larger than life egos and perfect images humility is a tough cell remember the bible verse pride goes before destruction proverbs its a truth many in hollywood struggle to embrace to apologize to god is to admit youre not the ultimate storyteller and for some thats the hardest plot twist of all then theres the fear of backlash in todays age of cancel culture every word and action is under scrutiny when stars speak openly about their faith or apologize publicly it often leads to polarizing reactions movies like the passion of the christ unbroken and even the shack remind us of the human need for forgiveness and guess what these films films resonate because they tap into something universal our longing to be right with god and each other the irony hollywoods most successful films often mirror the very thing they hesitate to embrace the power of saying im sorry take a moment to think about stars whove spoken openly about their faith journeys justin bieber once known for scandals publicly shared how turning back to god changed his life or denzel washington who regularly credits his success to his spiritual foundation and who can forget mel gibson despite his controversies the passion of the christ remains one of the highest grossing films of all time but heres the flip side what happens when hollywood ignores god the rise in scandals moral failures and public apologies is hard to ignore could it be that the industrys reluctance to it contributes to its struggles now billy graham once preached a sermon titled whats wrong with the world and today id like to pose the same question what is wrong with the world the answer is sin sin is whats wrong with the world and dare i say the love of sin is what makes everything worse mocking god involves disrespecting dishonoring or ignoring him it is a serious offense committed by those who have no fear of god or deny his existence the most recognizable form of mockery is disrespect often shown through verbal insults or derogatory actions it is linked to ridicule scoffing and defiance mockery is an attitude of dishonor it demonstrates low estimation contempt or even open hostility the bible refers to mockery as a behavior and attitude demonstrated by the fool psalm the wicked psalm the enemy psalm the hater of knowledge the proud psalm isaiah and the unteachable a mocker goes beyond mere lack of judgment to making a conscious decision for evil mockers lack a spirit of obedience teachability discernment wisdom worship or faith people have often mocked those who speak on behalf of god the prophet jeremiah describes how he became the laughing stock of his people and was relentlessly mocked mockery of gods prophets was quite common throughout history nehemiah too faced mockery from his enemies as did elisha and jesus herod roman soldiers a thief on the cross and jewish leaders all participated in mocking jesus charles gfny a preacher in the s wrote about the effects of mocking god to mock god is to pretend to love and serve him when we do not to act in a false manner to be insincere and hypocritical in our professions pretending to obey him love serve and worship him when we do not mocking god grieves the holy spirit and sears the conscience and thus the bands of sin become stronger and stronger the heart becomes gradually hardened by such a process it is important to remember the following text god warns that mockery of what is holy will be punished zephaniah predicted the downfall of moab and ammon saying this is what they will get in return for their pride for insulting and mocking the people of the lord almighty isaiah warns that mockery will cause the chains of judahs sin to become stronger and that destruction will follow proverbs says that god will mock the mocker but give favor to the humble and oppressed second kings records the punishment that befell the youths who jered elisha the concept of god is not mocked means that there are consequences for disregard regarding gods instructions and deliberately choosing to sin for example adam and eves disobedience brought sorrow and death into the world the bible points the way to living a blessed life through the good examples of godly individuals and the negative examples of those who choose a different path psalm says blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers but whose delight is in the law of the lord and who meditates on his law day and night that person is like a tree planted by streams of water which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither whatever they do prospers every day in every part of the world there are people who mock god many go out of their way to blaspheme ridicule and shake their fist at their creator the amount of mockery is disheartening and its audacity is often breathtaking god sees all this and surely he could do something about it why does he allow it to continue the passage from revelation states thou art worthy oh lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created kjv this shows that god created mankind with free will for his glory and pleasure he didnt want mindless drones but rather individuals with their own quirks and personalities much like parents want children this all shows that the genuine love god desires from us is voluntary and because god created mankind this way of course he did not have to but chose to we have the free will to disobey him blaspheme him and yes even mock him but we are warned in galatians that god will not always be mocked the blasphemy and derision are temporary there will be a day of reckoning and ultimately a man reaps what he sws we have the ability to choose good or evil right or wrong god also gave us a solution a way out of sin and into eternal life jesus christ has provided the means of restoring a loving relationship with god through his sacrifice on the cross but the bible has already warned us of all these in two passages of the bible it is mentioned that in the last days scoffers will come in this context a scoffer is someone who mocks christ ridicules the things of god and opposes the gospel both peter and jude were cautioning against false teachers who were trying to lead others astray the the term scoffer is used to describe someone who rejects the truths of scripture and leads others into following their incorrect beliefs scoffers have been present since the garden of eden satans first temptation of man was in the form of scoffing at gods command did god really say genesis scoffers dominated noahs day genesis leaving god with little choice but to destroy them all and start over with noah the only righteous man on earth scoffers refused to believe the word of the lord and set themselves up as their own gods in chronicles the psalmist warns against the digression that leads from casual association with wicked people to sitting in the seat of scoffers throughout history there have always been people who scoff at the ideas of faith and the return of the lord according to scripture as the day of the lord approaches this scoffing will become more prevalent peter describes these scoffers as individuals who follow their own evil desires and question the second coming of the lord jesus despite the passage of thousands of years since jesus promised to return for his faithful followers scoffers ridicule those who continue to wait and eagerly anticipate his appearance jude describes the scoffers of the last days as people who follow ungodly desires and create division in the church they may even present themselves as church leaders but they do not have the spirit verse paul also discusses the condition of the world before jesus returns stating that there will be terrible times in the last days people will be characterized as lovers of themselves lovers of money boastful proud loud abusive disobedient to their parents ungrateful unholy without love unforgiving slanderous without selfcontrol brutal not lovers of the good treacherous rash conceited lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying its power in this context scoffers will fit right in with such a crowd we are witnessing an increase in the number of scoffers in todays world and this new world without moral boundaries is producing scoffers instead of thinkers some use their scientific training to argue that since the reality of the creator god cannot be proved by mans understanding god must not exist by rejecting scripture mankind has lost its moral compass leaving us with no way to determine right or wrong good or bad truth or lie in this climate anyone who claims to know the truth is a prime target for scoffers arrogance leads to scoffing much as it did before the tower of babel genesis when people become puffed up with their own importance they begin to challenge anything that threatens their high opinion of themselves once we have removed the idea of god from consideration then anything goes although they knew god they neither glorified him as god nor gave thanks to him but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened although they claimed to be wise they became fools it is crucial for every christian to take seriously the instruction to study and contemplate on gods word but understand this that in the last days dangerous times of great stress and trouble will come difficult days that will be hard to bear the apostle directly shares with timothy a description of the conditions that will prevail across the earth just before the return of the lord it has been pointed out several times that the list of crimes that follows is strikingly similar to the description of the godless pagan that can be seen in romans the amazing thing is that the same conditions among the heathen will characterize is professing believers in the last days this is so solemn the last days referred to here are the days between the apostolic period and the appearance of christ to set up his kingdom for people will be lovers of self narcissistic selffocused lovers of money impelled by greed boastful arrogant revilers disobedient to parents ungrateful unholy and profane one can cannot read these verses without being struck by the word lovers repetition for example in verse two we find lovers of self and lovers of money in verse three the phrase despisers of good literally means no lovers of good in verse four we read of lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god characteristics of mankind in the last days are given in verses to lovers of themselves which means selfcentered vain and egotistical lovers of money which means avaricious boasters which means braggards proud which means haughty overbearing blasphemers which means evil speakers profane disobedient to parents which means undutiful uncontrolled unthankful which which means ungrateful unholy which means irreverent holding nothing sacred unloving which means hardhearted unnaturally callous unforgiving which means implacable refusing to make peace slanderers which means spreading false and malicious reports without selfcontrol which means men with uncontrolled passions brutal which means unprincipled despisers of good which means haters of whatever or whoever is good traitors which means betrayers headstrong which means reckless rash hay which means making empty pretensions conceited lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god which means those who love sensual pleasures but not god and they will be unloving devoid of natural human affection callous and inhumane irreconcilable malicious gossips devoid of selfcontrol intemperate immoral brutal haters of good traitors reckless conceited lovers of sensual pleasure rather than lovers of god holding to a form of outward godliness religion although they have denied its power or their conduct nullifies their claim of faith a avoid such people and keep far away from them though they keep up a form of religion they will have nothing to do with it as a force from all such individuals timothy is encouraged to turn away for among them are those who worm their way into homes and captivate morally weak and spiritually dwarfed women weighed down by the burden of their sins easily swayed by various impulses paul is calling out a specific group of leaders and teachers of false cults as particularly corrupt among the men of the end days first and foremost we read that they creep or worm their way into homes they wouldnt be able to enter many of these homes if they revealed their true identity so they use subtle devices such as talking about god the bible and jesus even if they do not believe what scripture teaches they are depicted as loaded down with sins led away by various lusts this suggests first of all that they are burdened by a sense of sin and feel a need in their lives it is at this crucial time that the false cultists arrive how sad it is that those who know the truth of gods word are not more zealous in reaching these anxious souls the second thing we discover is the many lusts individuals have to lead them astray the thought seems to be that conscious of their load of sin and seeking relief from it they are willing to expose themselves to every passing wind of doctrine and every religious novelty always learning and listening to anybody who will teach them but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth just as janas and jamras the court magicians of egypt opposed moses so these men also oppos the truth men of depra d mind unqualified and worthless as teachers in regard to the faith paul refers to the leaders and teachers of false cults comparing them to giannis and jambres who opposed moses although not mentioned by name in the bible it is widely believed that they were two of the main egyptian magicians summoned by pharaoh to imitate mosess miracles they resisted moses by imitating his works and performing fake miracles this is exactly what the false cultists do the most significant single test that can be applied to them is to ask the simple question is jesus christ god but they will not get very far for their meaningless nonsense and ignorance will become obvious to everyone as was that of jannis and jambus paul assures timothy that the false teachers will not advance any further the problem is that they appear to be prospering on on every hand in every age and nothing appears to be impeding their progress in the world although they appear to prosper mightily and for a long time the time comes when their deception is exposed to all they can guide men up to a point even offering some measure of reformation they fail however because they lack regeneration janis and jras were able to imitate moses to some extent through their magical acts they were completely powerless however when it came to creating life from death this is the point at which the false cults are defeated now you have diligently followed my example that is my teaching conduct purpose faith patience love steadfastness second timothy and are determined to live godly lives in christ jesus will be hunted and persecuted because of their faith timothy persecution is an unavoidable part of living a devout christian life this is something that every young timothy should be reminded of otherwise when he is called upon to cross deep waters he may be tempted to believe that he has failed the lord or that the lord is angry with him for some reason paul was under no delusion that the world would progressively become better and better and that eventually all men would be converted to christianity instead he was aware through some sort of spiritual revelation that the complete opposite would transpire evil men and imposters will only get worse theyd become more subtle in their tactics and more daring in their attacks they would not only deceive others but they would also become entangled by the very false teaching with which they sought to trap their listeners pauls message to us is we must knowingly avoid empty religion and those who propagate it its all no matter how hard it seems theres freedom in letting go of pride so where does that leave us hollywood may be slow to say sorry to god but theres hope faithbased films are gaining traction stars are finding their voices and audiences are hungry for stories that inspire the road to humility might be long but every step matters
mNrxgad4atM,why its hard for hollywood to say sorry to god,youll always be okay if you seek first the kingdom of god youll always be okay youll get what you need look at the flowers of the field look at the birds of the air they get fed they get clothed i mean its matthew i think but i feel like im you know im being stripped down and prepared for something before we look at the one thing that could instantly transform a suffering hollywood watch this and what about those who use the city as a base for their own ministries like ray comfort and he recently claimed that the fire sweeping through the area were gods judgment on the city the problem with this narrative its not just flawed its dangerous it distorts the gospel hold on i didnt say that shes talking about one of our videos that went viral this is what i actually said are these fires some sort of judgment of god no one really knows then she said does it make sense to claim that god would punish the entire city because of the words of one actress what most dont understand is that gods wrath is cumulative that means he stores it up sometimes for years the bible says but in accordance with your hardness and impenitent heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath but as we see in scripture there have been times when that wrath spills over as in the case of sodom and gomorrah the bible tells us why god turned those cities into ashes and turning the city cities of sodom and gomorrah into ashes making them an example to those who afterward would live ungodly homes in ashes it was just us id be really okay with this but its everybody its its everything a lot of people come up here and they thank jesus for this award i want you to know that no one had less to do with this award than jesus he didnt help me a bit jesus this award is my god now the batman movie used the name of jesus times and blast for me did you know that i did not know that my faith always taught me what would jesus do and i know jesus would be attending that pride parade jesus would be the grand marshal at the pride parade you ever read the bible god rested took a rest what was happened to you was you were performing a task you up and you thought let me rest before i this up some more and our loves not a sin well the bible says it so well the bible says a lot of things you know hey hows it going god is dead satan lives the duo hit the stage to deliver a majorly racy performance of their hit song unholy and thats just a tiny tip of the mass of iceberg for years hollywood has mocked christianity promoted adultery fornication pornography blasphemy witchcraft satanism and proudly pushed its agenda of what the bible calls vile affections again we dont know if those fires are the judgment of god but we do know that theyre not s of his blessing and we certainly have provoked his wrath i feel like im you know im being stripped down and prepared for something why do you think god lets these things happen just because of nature you believe in god not really no so you think nothing created everything thats scientifically impossible i believe in like spiritual like witchcraft jay where are you going when you die i would like to believe heaven are you a good person i think i am a good person how many lies have you told in your life ive have told lies you stolen something even if its small a few times yeah you could steal something today and tomorrow you could do something really good for someone try that in a court of law robbed a bank judge but im doing good things for people today hes going to say you going to jail doing good things doesnt wash away crimes in mans court and it doesnt in gods court seventh commandment you shall not commit adultery have you ever committed adultery i have not committed adultery no now jesus said if you look at a woman and lust for her you commit adultery with her in your heart would you last look at pornography three months ago do you know the bible says each of us have a multitude of sins that god sees our thought life and every time you sin you store up gods wrath you ever use gods name in vain probably if you do you love your mom i do would you ever use her name as a cuss word oh no no cuz you respect her yeah you dont respect the god that gave you a mother youve taken us holy name and use it as a cw word you had sex before marriage i have yet youve just told me youre a lying thief a blasphemer a fornicator an adulterate heart and a selfrighteous person and selfrighteousness is a sin in gods eyes and saying youre a good person when youre not youre like the rest of us so if god judges you by the ten commandments on judgment day youre going to be innocent or guilty if its based off that criteria you just stated and then i would say guilty have you ever heard the bible verse the wages of sin is death i have not know its very famous to say that god is paying you in death for your sins like a judge who looks at a criminal whos committed murder he says judge im a good person the judge says im going to show you how serious your crime is im giving you the death sentence this is your wages this is what you have earned and jay sin is so serious to a holy god has given you the death sentence youre on death row youre in a holding cell this life is a holding cell good blue roof nice air conditioning good lighting but this life is a holding cell and your death will be evidence to you that god is deadly serious about sin do you know what contrition is it means to be sorry for your sins contrary its what can heal a marriage if a husbands sisters wife honey im really sorry and she says so am i and there tears of reconciliation in a second they could be reconciled because of humility and contrition what keeps people apart is pride and thats what keeps us apart from god our own pride bible says god resists the proud gives grace to the humble if youre guilty on judgment day would you go to heaven or hell maybe heaven i feel like god would see remorseful i am of maybe some of the actions that ive done so you are sorry for your sins i i am yeah if you heard of jesus dying on the cross oh yeah now most people know that but they dont know this and ephra if you can get a grip of this its going to change everything for you so dont let anything distract you the ten commandments are called the moral law you and i broke the law jesus paid the fine thats why he said it is finished just before he died he was saying paid in full if youre in court youve got speeding fines and you guilty you fess up the judge will let you go if someone else pays those fines and its legal you say youre guilty but you can leave because someone paid you fine god can grant you everlasting life as a free gift because jesus paid the fine and full he can legally dismiss your case forgive your sins or because of the death and resurrection of jesus what you have to do to find everlasting life is repent of your sins and youll never do that while you think youre a good person and trust in jesus and the bible promises god will grant you everlasting life not because youre good but because hes good and kind and rich in mercy tell you a little story i want to ask you a question after it to see how perceptive you are little kid was looking at a glass case and there was a vase in the case and his dad said dont touch that vase its very expensive kid says okay dad goes to work kid opens the case just to see if it is expensive holds it in his hand he thinks this is just like the one in the supermarket ive seen for why would dad lie to me and suddenly the father comes up the driveing his car kid panics goes to put it in the case hits the top of the case and shatters into a thousand pieces when his dad comes in he says dad i broke that vas thing but its okay i can get another one at the supermarket with a ive got in the bank his dad said that was no cheap vas that was an antique worth tears suddenly welled in the childs eyes and he said dad im so sorry and the father said son i can see youre truly sorry its going to cost everything ive got but ill buy a new one myself now heres the question what was it that produced sorrow in in the heart of that child the value of the vas its exactly right once he realized it was worth that showed him the seriousness of what he had done and he was able to find a place of sorrow of heart and you and i think lightly of gods law but once we understand how much god values justice and truth and righteousness and what the father did to make things right between you and i and him it should break our hearts that god became a human being in christ suffered and died on that cross so we could be forgiven jay the night i became a christian many years ago when i was confronted with that same law and realized that lust was adultery in gods eyes i wasnt really sorry i just sorry id been caught but once i saw that cross the payment that god went to the father went to to make things right that broke my heart that produced sorrow in my heart so if you want to see how angry god is at sin look to the battered and bruised body of the son of god as he rise on that cross as he cries my god my god why have you forsaken me as a soul was made an offering for sin seeing the cost of the father to make things right so we get have everlasting life will produce contrition or sorrow in your heart is that making sense oh yeah it does make sense does that make sense yeah sense you going to think about what we talked about yeah think about it you would yeah when are you going to repent and put your trust in jesus as soon as possible are you sorry for your sins yeah i so can i pray with you yeah you can so when are you going to repent and put your trust in jesus maybe i can start today are you sorry for your sins i yes i yeah i am can i pray with you uh yeah you can yeah father i pray for ephraim please help him to understand the the gravity of what were talking about as eternal salvation father thank you for jays open heart i pray today hed be genuinely sorry for his sins that he would see the cross that he understand your wrath against sin but your love for him and this day may he be born again be given a new heart a new desires pass from death to life all because of your amazing grace in jesus name we pray amen im going to give you a gospel of john and which is the fourth book of the new testament and i would like to give you a book ive written called scientific facts in the bible is that okay uh yeah thats okay it it was an odd mixture of u of sadness and kind of a weird realization and and blessing i think because i thought you know theyre just things um i mean yeah im going to miss some stuff there was valuable stuff there was personal stuff that just breaks my heart you know but um um you know uh i feel like im you know im being stripped down and prepared for something else god gives god takes we come in with nothing thats the same way we go out you know and um heres the deal youll always be okay m if you seek first the kingdom of god youll always be okay youll get what you need look at the flowers of the field look at the birds of the air they get fed they get clothed i mean its matthew i think but uh im a that was one of my dads favorite passages he said stop worrying about stuff about money about stuff so you know that thats i think i you know he put that in my head when i was very young and it stayed and i believe it thanks to the generosity of our publishers we were able to get a massive print of

and today were counting down our picks for the top hollywood rumors that turned out to be true its just one of the disaster situations that ive created and its the worst thing that ive ever done for this list well be looking at various rumors within and around the film industry that were later confirmed well be covering the lighter as well as the more serious stories some of these may have also been the worst kept secrets at the time so long as they were publicly unsubstantiated are there any we missed let us know in the comments number anthony ramos and jasmine cephas jones is split a lot of movie stars try to keep the limelight away from their personal and romantic lives which we totally understand but that unfortunately leads to a lot of onlookers to jump to conclusions in in the heights actor anthony ramos was reportedly spotted getting chummy with an unidentified woman at a club despite ostensibly being engaged at the time to his hamilton costar jasmine cephas jones this story was broken by a ticktock user leading to speculation that ramos was cheating on jones or that the pair was no longer together just a day later however a followup story broke that the two had indeed called it off sometime prior number nine dean mcdermotts infidelity i cheated on my wife im really mad i was out of control in actors dean mcdermott and tori spelling married after meeting on the lifetime movie mind over murder they since had five children but began to undergo public personal struggles starting in in december of that year us weekly broke a story that mcdermott had been unfaithful to spelling mcdermott entered rehab the following month pauled by numerous other rumors regarding their troubled marriage in april lifetime debuted a docuseries titled true tori which addressed mcdermotts cheating in the first episode i got a call from my publicist and she said i just want to tell you something its a girl and shes claiming that she had an affair with dean in toronto when he was there the couple stayed together in the coming years though were said to be undergoing a trial separation as of june dean has been caught in so many lies and infidelities over the years and tori is just over it number eight charlie sheen and the black book at this point the life and times of charlie sheen have been well documented but back in the s much of it was the subject of speculation hey look im not saying i dont trust you and im not saying i do but i dont in a woman named heidi fleiss was arrested for acting as a madam operating a ring of sex workers in los angeles though fleis has been historically tightlipped about her clientele one name that leaked early was that of hot shots actor charlie sheen this was due to a travelers check with sheens name on it being found on fleiss person at the time of her arrest heidi arranged women for charlie back in the s and he testified against flies after his name came up in her black book of klein in sheen testified at fleischs trial confirming hed used her service over two dozen times i have never spoken to charlie since then at the time when he did testify against me of course i had some harsh feelings but i was young and i didnt understand why he was doing it number seven jamie foxx and katie holmess relationship whereas some actors try to hide a breakup others try to hide an entire sixyear relationship such was the case with jamie foxx and katie holmes who reportedly dated from to in fact rumor theres a rose about them from the jump but consistent repudiations kept news stories from presenting it as fact i saw pictures did you and katie holmes play basketball for valentines day like some real loving basketball game oh music did we lose it fox and holmes were even photographed holding hands on multiple occasions but they continued to deny the claims so i guess some knucklehead who was here with the fam cam you know im saying i guess they try to get money from whatever i said but you know i mean like i said its amazing what people will do to sell you out it wasnt until the pair split that the public got any confirmation they were ever together they are just both caught up in their own families careers and obligations that their relationship had to take a back seat it must take a lot to hide a relationship for half a dozen years but good for them for keeping their private lives private as possible number six ben affleck and the nanny ben affleck has had a much publicized romantic life over the years from jennifer lopez to jennifer gardner and back to lopez but it was a lesserknown woman who got the rumor mill going its a bombshell report has ben affleck been dating the family nanny and here she is surrounded by paparazzi in apple fleck and garner announced their separation that same year reports began to circulate that aflac had also entered a relationship with their childrens nanny affleck threatened to file a lawsuit over the allegations at the time but didnt all allegations of a romantic relationship are baseless and untrue in a year before the actors officially filed for divorce garner confirmed the tryst however garner also claimed the two were already separated before she learned of the development we had been separated for months before i ever heard about the nanny she had nothing to do with our decision to divorce number five ellen degeneress sexuality theyd like to think were past speculating on someones sexuality but we definitely werent back in the s has there ever been anyone you felt you clicked with and what was his name susan its not at the time for her selftitled sitcom ellen degeneres came out as a lesbian in he was even punctuated by her character coming out herself on her show however reports of the episode were leaked well in advance leading many publications to question whether degeneres herself was planning on coming out do you think i was gay oh wow im sorry i i just kind of got that vibe vibe like a gay vibe but like im giving off some kind of gay vibration others meanwhile wondered if the whole thing was merely a ratings ploy just a couple weeks prior to the episodes airing however degeneres put the story to bed by indeed confirming her sexuality why do i have to be so ashamed i mean why cant i just say the truth i mean be who i am im years old im so afraid to tell people i mean i just susan im gay number four kevin spaceys accusations what started as a playful cartoon gag became eerily shrewd in hindsight one of hollywoods best known actors kevin spacey the latest highprofile star caught up in allegation in the mids vague rumors about actor kevin spaceys sexuality and dealings within made their way to the family guy writers room in response the show featured a bit in a episode whereby baby stewie fabricates having escaped from spaceys basement ten bucks five bucks eight bucks and ill do it fine the clip began resurfacing in when spacey was accused of having sexually harassed fellow actor anthony rapp when the latter was underage im beyond horrified to hear his story i honestly do not remember the encounter it would have been over years ago but if i did behave then as he describes i owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior several others have since come out with similar accusations effectively halting spaces career and tarnishing his public image number three arnold schwarzeneggers illegitimate child actor arnold schwarzeneggers tenor as the governor of california came to an end in what also came to an end that year was his relationship with maria shriver this was without any doubt the biggest setback and the biggest failure though their divorce wouldnt be finalized for another years what prompted the split was the discovery that schwarzenegger had fathered a child in with their housemate mildred bana you wrote that if you told her then she would tell her family and youd be afraid that it would spin out from there exactly is what happened schwarzenegger wasnt even aware of this until the boy started taking on his distinctive features at which point he started providing financial support rumors regarding the child were finally put to bed in may of when schwarzenegger confirmed the story have you been able to be a father to joseph your son with mildred yes and you know i would look at him as a son and i will you know take care of him financially and also have mildred so thats my application that im doing it number two brangelina hollywood power couples are nothing new but few have marked the st century quite like brad pitt and angelina jolie dance with me foreign music from to pitt was married to jennifer aniston a friends fame but their split sparked gossip about he and joe lee his

iNcB8I2oNkM,ravensymone finally exposes the billionaire who run hollywood,im not an african am im an american oh girl dont set up twitter i said this upstairs and i maybe i didnt explain it but i just want to put it out there we have the paperwork to say that were equal segregation is gone civil rights is here its okay youre safe we have that paperwork but that doesnt change the minds of the people a working actor since age three raven simone was just years old when she retired from hollywood i needed a break the former cosby show star told people magazine in i needed to grow up i needed a moment to breathe the actress said growing up on sets was fun but she longed for a more normal childhood during the four seasons she spent on hanging with mr cooper raven was abused as a child star and she is now ready to speak out on how wealthy hollywood gatekeepers take advantage of young desperate actors with the promise of giving them a breakthrough in the very competitive industry i hated filming on fridays she said i was like i dont want to work i want to go home and watch family matters when mother lyd gden realized her daughter was stressed she enrolled her in art classes on the weekends and as the actresss celebrity status continued to rise thats so raven broke disney channel ratings records when it premiered in and she found success both on screen and on the music charts with the cheetah girls the young star began to feel more and more constrained by her disney girl image i remember on one show they were like stay in the box we created for you she says i was like shoot me in the face so in after a wellreviewed stint in broadways sister act simone decided to walk away from the career shed spent the last years pursuing i realized there had been a plan for me since i was a baby she says there was a bucket list that i didnt create but i just kept checking things off so i added i want to be the youngest person in my world to retire after months spent lying on the couch simon began seeing a therapist and enrolled as a fine arts major at the academy of art university in san francisco it wasnt until a close friend asked her to take a role in his short film that simone began dabbling and acting once again knowing she still had to pay the bills she began taking on projects that allowed her to work with friends including a role on empire which stars her pal jesse smet and her partner aarie livingston that slow return to acting accelerated to warp speed when simone was offered the opportunity to become a cohost on the view i am actually surprised i said yes she admits i was like wo are you returning to your old self but the actress who considers herself the luckiest girl in the world to be cohosting keeps those fears at bay thanks to a new work life balance mentality that calls for her to have at least hours a day where she doesnt have to be raven simone because she is a different beast ive done a lot of things in my life that ive just had to smile through she says but now im living life for myself but it hasnt always been tidy tidings for the child actor various studies have found black people experience negative treatment based not only on the color of their skin but even on their names those findings got an unexpected endorsement back in from a black celebrity who as one columnist put it was quite possibly the single blackest name in pop culture today why do you think thats important to mudsling and have these these words that obviously touch the hearts and souls of so many people of america in a segment on the view about judging people based on their names cohost raven simone said she would never hire someone named watermel andrea her detractor said the comment coming from someone with a unique name smacked of hypocrisy and perpetuated the idea that its okay to treat people poorly based on their names the segment on the abc show was based on a new study about racial bias toward black sounding names ucla researchers found people envisioned men with stereotypically black names as bigger and more violent during the segment a clip was played from the popular youtube video video top ghetto black names in which watermelon drea comes in at number after the video was played simone opined its not racist to judge people based on their names its simply discriminatory she continued i am very discriminatory against words like the ones they were saying in those names referring to examples of names in the video im not about to hire you if your name is watermelon drea its just not going to happen im not going to hire you her cohost had little to contribute prompting simone to ask is that mean cohost joy bahar added that white people tend to name their children after food apple honey prompting her to suggest to parents they stop naming their children when theyre hungry simones comments caught fire on social media and in opinion columns people were quick to say the comments from a black woman with an accented hyphenated name embodied irony and hypocrisy additionally in simone came under fire for not denouncing former univision host rodner figueroas claim that michelle obama resembled the cast from planet of the apes simone said on the show i dont think he was saying it racist she added not michelle obama michelle dont fire me from this right now but some people do look like animals is that rude the actress announced her departure live on the view in a late episode at the time her reasoning was that shed be busy executive producing and starring in disney channels ravens home which chronicles her psychic character raven baxter in adulthood while this was true there was more to simons exit than just a busy schedule during an interview on the view behind the table simone explained how her experience on the view wasnt what she thought it would be she said i feel like i just got catfished i thought i was going to a show where it was pop culture and fun and exciting and i got catfished and learned a good lesson in a separate interview with them simone elaborated on her catfishing claim despite being told the revamped version of the view wouldnt be politically focused she felt that it was the the actress also admitted on the view behind the table that she felt considerable pressure serving as the sole lgbtq host especially as someone who shies away from labels still she praises former cohost whoopy goldberg and the shows producers for being there for her behind the scenes although millennials and jenz alike will probably think of ravens first acting gig as her breakthrough on the disney channel hit series which fun fact was initially supposed to be called absolutely psychic she was aged only three that she made her hollywood debut and has lived to experience everything in the industry the good the bad and the untold joining from the premiere episode of the cosby shows sixth season as bill cosbys stepgranddaughter olivia raven ended up remaining on it until the series finale in from there she went on to feature in the eddie murphy comedy dr do little as well as its sequel dr do little fast forward to january and the iconic thats so raven debuted almost overnight the actress truly started making a name for herself and for good reason her acting and overall presence on the tv show played a big part in making it the channels highest rated and longest running series that is until it was surpassed by wizards of waverly place in october baxter aka the high school student who has a secret psychic ability that allows her to experience short visions of future events was simply hilarious accompanied by incredibly lovable supporting characters like her two best friends dy chelsea and aspiring rapper eddie as well as her two parents victor and tanya and her money obsessed younger brother corey baxter made previous disney superstars such as hillary duffs lizzie maguire seems simply lackluster once she got in it was clear that raven wasnt planning on going anywhere anytime soon one of her more niche parts was the voice role of monique on kim possible in which she had a recurring role as she was featured in all seasons of the show and participated in the two films for the series kim possible a sitch in time and kim possible so the drama other key roles for the actress include lead singer galleria gab baldi in the disney channels original movie the cheetah girls which was produced by the one and only grammy winner whitney houston raven also made an appearance in the princess diaries too royal engagement as princess assana and came back for her role in the cheetah girls o a jack of all trades the star also took over broadway in january as dolores van cardier in sister act and lets not forget her impressive music career which began in when the then sevenyearold signed with mca records she spent that year and the next taking vocal lessons from none other than missy elliott more recently in november the triple threat weve all seen the actress dance moves and thats so raven competed in season two of the masked singer as black widow on the ifth of october during a where are they now interview with talk host og oprah winfrey raven spoke about her strong sense of self her uality and made a lets say surprising remark about labels the former disney stars suity had been making headlines since she tweeted in august that she was happy for the legalization of gay marriage in the us as it meant that she could finally get married i dont want to be labeled gay the actress first stated on the talk show continuing i want to be labeled a human who loves humans im tired of being labeled im an american im not an african american as expected oprah pleaded oh girl dont set up twitter on fire what did you just say stop the tape right now raven went on to add i will say this i dont know where my roots go back to i dont know how far back and i dont know what country in africa im from but i do know that my roots are in louisiana im an american and thats a colorless person because we are all people i have lots of things running through my veins oprah telling raven that she was in for a lot of flak for saying youre not africanamer americ gave her another opportunity to be precise about her perspective i dont label myself what i really mean by that is im an american the actress continued i have darker skin i have a nice interesting grade of hair i connect with caucasians i connect with asians i connect with black i connect with each culture isnt that what america is supposed to be understandably and as oprah herself predicted raven strangely worded comments divided neens who took to twitter to share their views on it but it seems the backlash she received following that interview wasnt enough to stop the actress from continuing to run her mouth as only a year later during a segment on the view about judging people based on their names the cohost said she would never hire someone named watermelon drea as earlier discussed but one thing is clear raven starts speaking her mind after she realizes that she is riding alone in the murky waters of hollywood and being a child actor she is not alone in a episode of the view the actress recalled a the time when she was bodyshamed on set as a child i remember not being able to have the bagel or anything at we would call it crafty where its just a table of food ready for you to eat whatever you want and i remember people would be like you cant eat that youre getting fat im like im seven im hungry simone said during the episode she has also spoken out about how being body shamed so young caused a lot of mental issues for her she even went as far as to say that she wishes she grew up in a more body positive time like today all that coupled with being underpaid being blackballed and being stereotyped wasnt the best way to make a living in hollywood that said some people still believe shes one of the best actors to ever grace the screen one such fan tweeted lindsay lohan and raven simone are two of the greatest actors of their lifetime and im not kidding and thats it from us today until next time thank you for watching

vNibcr9RaMg,saif ali khan stabbed at home bollywood stars question safety in mumbais bandra india today,of the attack on se ali khan which has happened remember inside his residence in the dead of night now se and karina live in bandra west this is where you have all of the biggest celebrities of bollywood all residing in this very area very very close to where safe and karina live they live in the satguru apartment of bandra west and their neighbors just lanes away is shahu khans iconic manut residence which is a seaf facing bungalow of course of few buildings away from that again along bandra bandstand is salman khans residence salman stays a galaxy apartments and we already know of course the huge controversy surrounding salman khans safety security and the threats to his life he stays in bandra too amir khan another superstar lives in the bellavista apartments again in bandra vest he stays in pali hill now most of the big faces of bollywood stay along this entire area ranir kapurs residence krishna raj is also here aliia b her residence also vastu is in pali hill sanjay d same lane pali hill uh imperial heights is where he resides rea lives in sea springs again in bandra west a long bandstand again see facing zenat aman so your veterans of the industry also stay in this very stretch ana pand stays with her parents in the pande residence which is also in bandra now this is also in p hill uh faran akar lives on bandstand uh in vipasana his residence is called mala aurora also lives close by in bandra so bandra west is where you have your biggest bollywood celebrities and so there are questions being asked right now about whether they simply not adquate protection security being given in a highprofile area in the city of mumbai the fact that this has happened to sef and karina has led to in fact several actors also raising concerns over this incident celebrities have questioned whether theyre safe anymore in mumbai now while they were celebrities like junior ntr chiranjivi who did in fact express concern for se they were the likes of kunal kohi puja bat ravina tandan who said that its worrying that celebrities are being targeted in this manner theyre calling it disturbing theyre calling on the maharashtra government to take strict action so now were talking about this incident thats happened at se and karinas residence of sef being stabbed in his own home but there have been a string of such incidents that have happened in bandra that have happened uh in fact to salman khan and to other actors to other prominent figures who live in bandra for example just a few months ago the shocking incident of baba sidiki being killed right outside his son zishan sikis office this happened in bandra so you you think that that would trigger alarm bells that that would ensure a sea of security not at all because now you have had this incident in san karinas residence before this on april th you had two men actually opening fire outside galaxy apartments again this is mind you in bandra at salman khans residence and yet despite all of this youve got another incident being reported now in bandra of mumbai which is whats triggered in fact this wave of questions at the government on whether mumbai has become unsafe ritwick baliker is joining us live from mumbai with more details on this ritwick away from the politics there are obviously going to be questions asked of the administration of why we seeing so many incidents of crimes taking place against celebrities these are highprofile individuals so then your common mumbiker is going to ask what about me what about my safety absolutely so this is the question being asked today because uh uh not just opposition uh who is coming down heavily uh on the newly formed mahui government and home minister and chief minister dendra pavis but also people in mumbai are worrisome and they asking the same question because this is not the first in incidents in last to four months see that right in the of mumbai bandra uh really posh area highprofile area where most of the celebrities stay this is the third in incidents uh happening of attack and in one of the incident uh the ruling party alliance mla baba siddiki was also killed and his son an xmla jishan siddiki is also alleging that the investigation is not done properly the builder lobby involved is not being investigated properly so these are raising questions and obviously uh when we spoke to ubt this point is the government considering reing security in bandra considering multiple incidents of celebrities being targeted are we going to be seeing heightened security now being provided in bandra to these celebrities uh right after dendra fnav took charge as cm and home minister uh days plan for home ministry has been prepared and uh the use of artificial intelligence is what they are thinking upon which will be uh implemented soon in the next days is what home ministry is telling us uh the security of the people for the uh traffic and also uh uh minor petty crimes like theft and obviously uh some serious crimes like this would be addressed with the use of this new technology is what home minister is telling us now

episode is bollywood gossip with my man i love how youve put intelligent conversations and bollywood together you are a visionary yes yeah this dont people dont put these two and two together i ill tell you why ryal abraham one uh youre actually younger than me youre like youve been in bombay for like years itll be four years years four years in september and youve risen to a place in your career where people like dream of being okay and youve done that in years i feel that that is because of the big brain that you hide from the world yeah with you i ive told you this before i feel like youre the kind of person who shows one version of themselves to bollywood and the world yeah you are a little crazy i to tell you like you are creepy thats accurate right yeah okay so and then theres one yoga yeah thats my yoga thats my yoga talking i can see through people and theres one version of you that you keep to yourself where youre calculating where youre understanding how to get forward in your career but not a bad person youre not using that to like you know youre not using it to hurt someone youre just using it to progress your own career which is fine uh in this process of progressing talking to people heavy networking youre like one of the most crazily networked people that i know in my life uh you built like a massive bollywood network you have a lot of gup as you call it on bollywood a lot of gossip i do without names there is a lot of gup yeah uh in saying that with the gossip youve also got a lot of learnings which you always share with me you give me a lot of insights on how the bollywood business works how the hollywood industry works how the vibes are the drug culture the party and the sleeping around so oh my god what is this about you have like no chill straight into the drug culture the partying and the sleeping around well done yes and i think thats what the viewers are here for as well so ryal my first question to you is that is this drug culture partying and sleeping around a real thing in bollywood does it happen see i mean you know how um see when i came into the industry right obviously like i didnt come into i think im a part of the industry now because of like the people that im associated with otherwise for the job that i do i should ideally not be a part of bollywood as much and i should be a part of the media fraternity or whatever but i think when i came to bombay there always these notions of like like how you saying like theres drugs everywhere and theres everyone its like it sounds like a massive ay thats happening its its not that but its cool though i mean its its not just because its bollywood i think it happens everywhere right i feel like in bollywood see ive said this to a lot of people i feel like you will understand im sure because i think its entertainment and its creative i think people are a lot more liberal and a lot more chill when it comes to trying out things accepting yeah now when it comes to trying out things it could mean like it could be alcohol or drugs or like even sleeping around when you i mean you could say this in a very derogatory way but then you could also mean that youre just like just having sex with someone whatever right just chill like like and people are very chill with like everything and i think that comes with the space of being creative and meddling with art and all of that stuff got it so i think its a very chill space everyones very like accepting is a good word got it got it but is they also cheating on spouses and all that yeah okay thats not true gotta see ill tell you now i really feel like i mean theres a lot of it and um i mean i know people like neighbors who have done this from the industry and i have uh i might be even guilty of like encouraging it or like making a few happen but like im very chill though like see this again no judgments yeah like i feel like so there are people who are married and yet have open relationships in the industry there are people who are cheating on u their spouses with another person but like i remember having a conversation with this woman uh whos an actor and also like a uh superm model shes shes one a lot of pageants and stuff like that she told me shes married to this guy who doesnt live in live in bombay and he lives in delhi or as a businessman or whatever im giving away too much but um she told me that like emotional infidelity is the problem like physically if you are like because because if you know in biology we learned food sex and uh water are the three basic needs and now if im telling you that you can only drink from one water bottle but when youre thirsty you have to go back all the way home and then drink it its your basic need no so if its just about can i swear yeah yeah go for it yeah if its just about it out then might as well but if youre going back to the same person for your emotional needs yeah then because i feel like a lot of people a lot of couples in the industry have that so they very proper distinction so theyre sleeping around but emotionally theyre coming back home yeah okay even like the top actors in the industry yeah okay thats happening yeah damn yeah wow and i think its very progressive though okay like people cool its accepted in the industry yeah damn i mean otherwise that marriage wouldnt i mean see the thing is its not like its a marriage on compromise like we would like to imagine that oh my god like they might be having big problems and like you know theyre just together for the sake of it there are people at that also some of the biggest but like uh but there are also people who are very chill some from the young generation whove gotten married and they very about it do you know any of these people personally yeah are they emotionally in a good place yeah okay they actually a great place theyre at peace with yeah and i think that comes from a very good space of mind and like yoga and meditation well lets lets get to the next topic but what are your thoughts on this no are you okay with like uh in a relationship would you be okay with uh physical uh physical cheating infidelity no because like thats thats how ive been brought up those are my ethics but i dont judge anyone because ill tell you ill tell you even with me like personally in a relationship im very loyal but if i ever date somebody who is okay with being open id probably be not so okay with it in the beginning but maybe id come around you know because i i feel like as human beings were always learning in evolving yeah we might get there one day or not no no i i i get bombay ive grown up in this city so i understand the mentalities that go on in the city and each to his own for me at the end of the day i feel like if you have a strong set of ethics that youve been brought brought up with that you believe in and youre following that and youre happy following that if you yourself are at peace then thats what matters just for me its like ive been brought up in a very old school way like an old school guy i love in an old school way if i love someone i love them with like everything i have everything i do is for that person yeah you are telling me ive been brought up for years of my life in kerala yeah were going to get to that okay uh but can i tell you something about this drug culture because something ab just happened with the whole current post of the video and i felt really bad what video are you talking about karen posted karen had a party at his house there was vicki and shahid and v and like a lot of big people in the industry there was thea and shakun batra and ranir and i think rir was there i think i dont know ayan was there zoya was there all these people and there were these comment it was a video and they were probably drinking or like i dont know what they were doing what they wanted to theyre adults and they i mean i mean i understand the loss of the country but its a chill video of like people having fun and they were like slamed for like their eyes looking red and like they were like drugs and all that stuff and some mla slammed them on twitter saying uh like the these are drug rated bollywood and all that stuff i get very concerned when like uh when you just slam an industry b because this is the perception right its just like a massive a on mdma or something like that but its not and like im okay with like if people are doing a couple of things to relax because they have like hour shift sometimes and its like the accomplished people who have like worked their ass off to where they are today yeah i also i want to add one more thing to what youre saying uh definitely people have this negative soal of bollywood uh from the perspective of someone in the media industry dude to reach the top of bollywood forget the top even reach the top people in bollywood you need to be a hustler in life you need to be in a positive way an opportunist you need to be a great networker great communication skills uh you cant settle at just one hit movie yeah so youre perpetually a workaholic you know for life all these guys are incredibly hardworking and its not just the actors the top directors the top producers theyre very fast thinkers okay and thats why not everyone makes it in bollywood you can be goodlooking you can be a great dancer you can have a sexy body but then you need that x factor some people consider a dark x factor but that these days everybody has a good body and good looks but that x factor is what sets you yeah that yeah obviously i mean that that x factor is just like a mix of a lot of things i feel and like these days i mean a lot of things are coming to place i mean casting is a big thing has become like a lot more channel and systematic and all of that but then even if you do that one movie where youve been casted its not like um people are sitting there wanting to cast you again and again unless youre so good and thats been such a big launch and even for like so you have to know that a launch happens as a launch when a launch is happening they have like three movies planned its not like one movie because its very important that you have this one movie and in the next year in like s months you should have your next movie or at least announce it because otherwise people forget you so its very important to be like out there and be continuously working yeah yeah does parting help you get cast does parting help you grow your network in bollywood you are i mean its it helps you be seen right okay because you are see its its all about as much as i really want to believe that this is an industry based on merits and all of that its not okay its an industry that that likes working with people they who they like and they like yeah got it so party is this see im not saying that you go party or whatever im just saying chill also it could be a chill situation im not saying go get drunk and sleep with someone its just about being visible and you feel like youve made stuck up a conversation with them like imagine you are an actor and im a casting director we me a party we had a conversation we we hit it off and i i feel like i like your vibe and tomorrow im casting for something ill be like i like his vibe i want to work with him because i might have to work him for a month might as well like the guy yeah okay nice so thats the whole thing its not i mean again like people are saying oh party you know go home with its not that i mean there are people who does that also i have no problem whatever path you want to take please take but uh its about i mean its good to be seen yeah um my next question to you ryal is just give me three really controversial spicy stories from the world of bollywood you are like one janani youre like give me three stories with uh with or without taking names thats up to you okay can you n okay narrow it down for me you know like give me like a context to this give me like okay lets lets go like do do one and then give me like context for something like you give me something on the show something at a party something uh yeah could you give me like one okay give me like the wildest story you can recall like if i say the wildest story whats the story that pops up in your head thats the first one oh wild see i cant see again like its not a see now i this is not very v for me because see im very chill with casual sex right i mean so obviously like private parties are a scene and like house parties yeah there can be house parties or even a club for that matter which could be just taken for that party for that night so there are people like very close friends of mine who would like move from one person to the other in the same night and which is very chill like sex with one person to the other yeah i mean you cant have sex in the club but like you could like make out and move to the other person which is chill and i know of people who are like married and in like strong like e six year relationships who like comes to parties and like are very chill mhm and like i dont know see each do its own right i mean maybe like theyre okay with that or like theyre not but they still want to do it is there a lot of coke generally in bollywood cocaine uh yeah okay yeah but like again see its not like everyones doing it there are people who do it there are people who dont m but like i mean of course no ones like randomly throwing it on the see this is the idea right like we enter someones house and theres one on the uh like the the living room seat and then one in the dining room one in the bedroom thats on the scene ive seen that also ive seen ive seen parties where like but like every room someone snorting that has happened but like more like that was more like bollywood politics like oh s yeah something like that oh like like the were politicians and bollywood people as well yeah something like that damn oh so the mla who you tweeted about current party wow yeah crazy okay so thats one story that uh theres like what oh actually at this party this the the one where there was a lot of coke involved there was this one woman now its this is actually ridiculous for her to say this she is she lives in the us she has come down for this party and she has met a friend of mine amaya d who is an actor who is my junior from school by the way oh god really yeah but go shout out to amy whats up amy so amy was there and we were at both at this room and this woman is snorting this uh woman who lives in the us and we were like okay whatever uh then like so we dont do it so i was like we were just in the room so chilling whatever uh so now she she didnt know who amy was so she was like uh what do you do and there was another male actor in the same room okay so theres me amaya and this other male actor whos doing really well right now on the web and all of that stuff and uh she goes to amy she like what do you do you look so pretty youre lovely looking what do you do and shes like uh im an actor she was like oh dont tell me and i was like uh so she was like but why so is he hes also an actor and this girl this woman is like but thats different for him oh and and she was like you could do so much better why would you why would you be an actor and im like you are an educated woman who lives in the us you cant i mean illiteracy is not a complaint here yeah it blew my mind you know im like this is a modern setup contemporary like whatever and youre just like and being a woman youre like how can you be an actor im guessing this person is like a super old school actor no shes not not an actor oh okay like a like a business woman probably independent and selfmade you know wow crazy crazy um are there like physical fights in bollywood fist fights between guys or at least almost at the brink of becoming physical see ill tell you something the theres none in the young generation because everyones very safe what do you mean safe in the sense see obviously like with social media and phones and cameras and stuff like that no ones doing anything in public no ones fighting yeah no ones fighting no ones having a problem because you never know what will go out but ill tell you like see a lot of my friends are people who are becoming actors are people who are part of uh very uh what do you call it renowned households in the industry there are fights there that i mean because theyre also kids i mean what can you imagine theyre like to year old kids i mean there theres one whos like whos a very big actor son and there so there is this club called trist that we go to very often yeah and he got into a fist f someone on the center table which is on top you know that that one table which is like in the middle and i was like what the hell are you doing like one person takes out a phone this is like yeah yeah so obviously a lot of these fights dont happen because the older on slightly older ones still in the younger group theyre very aware of like what theyre doing they would never even like drink too much in a place like this you know unless its a house party or whatever then to but like its very like its very muted its there arent many fights like that people yeah but you said the older actors generation has actual fights that weve all heard what was that some uh san that fight and all we have heard i have no idea i forgot who he somebody he slapped in his house party like some other actor yeah oh damn there was a big like proper okay yeah but this i think is a little famous though like i forgot who he slapped but somebody has beat up okay got it and uh like my third story that i want to ask you is um is there anyone whos going through a lot of emotional trauma just because of the world but hides it like a lot like major mental health issues but like is hiding it yeah i mean see um i mean she would talk about this herself and im see im really proud of this one person im glad you asked me this um i mean i would take this opportunity to congratulate nora i think shes fing fabulous and she went through one of the darkest times that anybody could go through in this industry uh her i think the beginning uh and the relationship that she was was in was not good at all uh she spoken about before she spoken on the show but like but i think the way she just like changed it she went through a lot of it in her career and in her personal life but i think shes like a woman of strength and she motivates me majorly im all for people who are not from this place and like has no backing no kind of support and come to this place and like make it on their own i mean that thats what one reason i really look up to you bro thank you thank you yeah but like see i mean i i was going to say that i kind of did a bit of that but like see im not even close to what she has achieved but i mean she really motivates me like before coming here the reason why shes in my mind is because i watched an interview she gave and i messed her saying you have no idea how much youve grown and become mature and like you have like you know the things that you say now is because youve gone through those emotional trauma and mental trauma that you went through and like somewhere like shes also glad that she went through because that probably made her the person that she is today but its fantastic shes crazy extremely talented extremely hardworking i mean hours is like less for her to work you know so i mean bro um as much as i love this conversation you still need a third hardcore story so i remember i shot this episode with rich chad and malika daa richa and malika are people that i know for a while before u in a in a very friendly way weve been in the same group parted multiple times so this was like a not a not no promotions associated just a very candid chat and um like while i really love kangana as an actor im not a fan of the way she conducts herself in terms of uh the comments that she makes and like the way she disses people in the industry and like just says nasty things about other contemporaries and all of that im not and especially her sister whos just just like like i dont know what shes its just like if twitter is a dark place shes the black hole that that rangoli chandel twitter needs to be banned okay the kind of that she says on that platform is just crazy you cant say things like that about people so i wanted because rich and malika are very openly um i mean vocal people i wanted to get an opinion on this because i felt like if youre a strong actor a strong woman in the industry doesnt mean you have to like step on other people in the industry you can be a great actor have opinions on a lot of things but that doesnt mean you have to stand on like other people in the industry to prove that im wrong strong or whatever so i asked them i was like because you are open and all of that youre strong women industry too what do you think of her now malika said something very safe and she she was like but you know you cant ignore her past blah blah blah and rich said something very um very chill she said like if i had a problem with somebody i wouldnt um um have a war of words on a public platform id rather do it oneonone i think two weeks later is when we are airing this and of course theres pr around the episode theres people who watch the show now i think malika spoke about her fathers her father was accused on me too and i we spoke about that and uh so she got back to me saying over the two weeks she told me that ren if the pr puts it out then itll be a big like a lynch mob situation again theyll troll me on twitter and i dont want it can you take it out from the pr release that you guys sent so i said absolutely so taking one piece of thing out was not a big thing but i did i do that all the time now rich never got back to me her manager was on set pr was on set there no problem now obviously she has spoken about kangana this was in the episode nobody saw this becoming a thing it blew up it blew up rangoli was tweeting against her she was doing i think she probably got scared because she was doing a movie with gangana called panga and uh miss rano is very famous for cutting out people out of their movies in the edit because shes usually closely associated with the the editing of the movie and these days shes directing also so you never know so she i woke up to a this happened in then night because rangoli usually tweet sometimes tweets in the night and i was sleeping i woke up to a miss call from richa and i called her back and then she was like so i said i just woke up whats up and then she was like did you do you know what happened so i was like no and then she was like oh rangi is sweeted blah blah blah and then she said something on the lines of uh youve used my friendship to do this and i was like uh so i was very polite in the whole conversation it went on for about i think minutes she spoke about how im i will use my friend ship with others in the industry to to get yeah to get controversial things on my show and to get headlines and thats ruining them and i as polite as i could be i was all of that in that call uh where i very politely told her that babe you have the um equation with me where you could just message me and tell me to take this out your pr was onet who said nothing your manager was onet who would said nothing your whole team was there they you never got back we saw this two weeks ago and then she said something on the line she took amys name because she knew we were best friends and she said im going to tell amy that youre going to use her friendship to uh your advantage and like make something controversial out of it and that like this was the first call i was doing in the morning i was in my bed you know i almost teared up and then i called amy and i spoke whatever and then this woman started sending me links of like articles online so i called up and this went on like through the day this is like like she was like oh this has come this has come what do you mean what do you mean and im explaining everything to her and then in the end i called up her manager and i said listen this is too much your talent like is attacking me so then her manager was saying no no she might be like doing it in the spur of a moment shell call you an apology i said no i dont want any apology just let this go like i just want i want no communication with this person so because for me i was like because sometimes you know they want to say things they want to be opinionated uh opinionated what whatever but then uh sometimes when goes uh loose then they get very nervous so r tell me one thing bro does this success in the acting world in bollywood get to peoples heads yeah so i mean yeah like i i dont want to take this name because i mean thatll become too controversial but i know of of an actor whos become fairly big right now whos doing some of the biggest movies working with really good act uh directors and actors and all of that um i remember meeting this person when um and i he i he was on the rise yeah and like he had like movies that never worked like two three of them and there one movie which like blew up okay not the best movie in terms of content slightly sexist or something uh sorry was the movie sexist yeah okay very and and and he had like a bunch of movies before that one movie took off okay cool go on so yeah so and then this person just changed dude and like i have like i know of stories where anyway thats fine like very like so i was actually going for i mean like stupid silly cheap things that hes done at parties and like very like uh u yeah very stupid things and then like he was known for that you know and suddenly like hes become like this arrogant thing like who who would like look through people at uh places and like i mean its i mean its not its not about me i mean i dont care im not but i know of like from actors that hes working with now and who who said like we have no idea what what has happened to him and you know these are actors who who achieved a lot more than he has and while i understand that the bollywood hero is the important thing in a movie but uh they hes working with some of the actors who have been in the industry for a while now you know and has done much better work than he has but yeah it changes people but there also people who are very cool yeah i mean i think yeah i think vicky is fantastic i think i i would put my money on vicky goel to become i want to say the next akumar but i think he can be the first vicky goel yeah yeah i think its crazy and i also feel like see when i meet like a shuk i feel like i mean see he doesnt hes shah ruk khan he doesnt have to make you feel comfortable he doesnt have to give you his time even if hes giving you like minutes for your show he doesnt have to give you his best he can just sit there and not talk for minutes and i would still be happy id be like shah ruk sat here for im happy but he humble grounded gives you his best every time would i have never seen him in a bad mood if in front of the camera or like you know if he walks into you he just makes sure that i mean he doesnt have to come into my crew and ask them if they have had dinner i mean why would he care right so i feel like when youre completely secure there is no like arrogance and like being or like this you know like this one attitude where like where you know that success gone to your head it i think its that middle space where youve just suddenly grown and you have no idea what to do with it that happens a lot and then there are people who are like some of these um there is one uh from a very entitled family in bollywood uh which is and a couple of them are doing fine but like one is there who is so entitled and he is he hits up like people on dm like including bloggers uh models hes the son yeah hes the son uh the models like bloggers or whatever so three kids may say hes the son and hes the one whos like uh doing this i dont know how many kids are there but like hes the son there are multiple people but you said the the couple of others okay go on go on im sorry yeah i mean couple of others has like its a form of saying no its like whatever way of saying okay ranir uh this podcast is not called ending reynolds career okay ryal bro your career is already safe because youre one of the most intelligent chill people on social media yeah you keep saying this but like sometimes when i say these things i feel like im not no no you youre youre good yeah but this guy he is like uh he hits up these people and he wants to sleep with all of them and actors also who are like in their nasal stages in the industry or whatever and he really feels like because hes from there they must sleep with him got it and ive heard this from multiple people and he feels like um and he gets like upset if they dont sleep with him hell be like how can they not sleep with me i have you seen yourself people would have standards know like money is not the only thing got it yeah um coming back to the positives of bollywood dude shah ruk khan man you said how hes humble you said how you know he carries himself with positivity everywhere on a personal dude hes someone who inspires me a lot theres certain people who i study in my life one of them is verat kohi another ones someone like sidat roy kapor karan is someone i studyed shah khan and try eming pieces of their personality dude the way that guy carries himself into rooms the way he carries himself on screen yeah h man like i completely get what youre saying in terms of um hes hes magnetic and also you understand why life has allowed him to grow to that pedestal right now like if he flops in every other movie after this people will still remember him as the superhit hero thats what hes been able to achieve and you cant even say that about like people who actually who are doing well continuously now years you know but you say that about shuk khan when an entire generation looks back at like to theyll be like okay those are shuks years and no one else is yeah but what is what is like the most interesting thing for you when it comes to shah ruk when it comes to shah ruk yeah so i studied like you said that you emb like qualities from different people right so what did you take from shah ruk uh okay ill answer your first question first whats the most interesting thing is that hes been a lowkey struggler not too many people know about his struggles hes made it big late in life relatively late okay uh and in terms of u what i take from him what i is class as in there is something called new money and something called old money in the world new money is where you suddenly become rich overnight and you dont know what to do which is what youre saying about that young actor whos had one hit film and what happens to a lot of people old money is when your familys had money for two three generations and youre brought up in wealth youre brought up amongst wealthy you dont you dont show off you dont you know go out hunting for things youre very comfortable and secure who you are shah ru

8SOBH67vieA,saif ali khan stabbed at home political reaction from across india india today news,to the viewer tuning in right now if youre wondering what exactly happened in bandr sef and karinas residence at am inside the residence there was a sound noise noticed and a scream basically from the house help and se ali khan woke up according to reports coming in to realized that there was an intruder with not the best intentions and was very close to his two children this happened at am se ali khan then confronted him got stabbed in return at in at least six stabbing wounds two deep once on the neck and near the spine eventually however the intruder managed to flee the spot now the intruder entered into this premises using a fire escape reportedly as the police are investigating that there was possibly a certain duct that he was aware about and that opened into the private chambers of the family he entered thats when the house help was either woke up or already was awake and heard some noise and thats when uh sef intervened remember its for the protection of your family members according to information apart from sef karina and both the children were at the house at that time u while the house help also has uh gained certain injuries is what we are told on the arm but for sef to have been stabbed six times attacked the hous help as well and then managed to escape by am bleeding profusely sef ali khan was rushed by the family members to leelawati hospital where the top team of neurosurgeons cardiologists and cosmetic surgeons as well uh did come in immediately operated upon him hes currently out of danger but a lot of questions unanswered who was that intruder when will he be nabbed and what happens to the security of the area mustafa and anita continue to be with us on that uh mustafa do you also think its a race against time because who was this man and if not caught in time could possibly flee from not just the area but the city well thats true because see the way s khan has been attacked you can say that one there can be a person who is attacking when hes caught doing something or or something like that but the way he has been attacked sef alan has been grievously attacked so there are injuries while he was blocking the knife attack from his hand so there are superficial injuries on his hands but at the same time it seems that there are two grievous injuries one near his neck the other one uh on on the back side near his spinal cord and a piece of about and a half inches of sharp blade from the knife has been found and removed from sef alik khan so this seems to be a fierce fight fier spce off which has taken place the attacker was not scared that he might be later caught or anything that he attacked sef al kh in a way that it could have caused st his life so this is a very serious crime he not being naed as we said and again im saying that mumbai police also must be in the pressure to resolve and solve and c catch this question at the same time but at the same time as you rightly said that there are many ways venues available for the accuse to escape and not get caught from its its its the golden are if the more time it takes to arrest the accus the more possibilities of he fleeing the city fleeing the state and hiding somewhere which can may take some more time to arrest him so unless the accus is arrested the final motive and the how the crime took place whether the weapon he got where did he get the weapon what was the int his intention so these are things which only be simply a a burglary attempt which is of course bad enough or was it perhaps something more dangerous something more menacing in nature the intruder enters into sef ali khans bandra house that recently shifted a year or two ago and this intruder appears to be in an argument with the house help thats when uh se alik khan realizes that there is someone in the house and comes in so weve tried to put forth an illustration that thats how that possibly what happened hes managed to get very close to the childrens room or possibly was inside the childrens room as well thats when se al khan and the housel tred to pacify this individual but they realize that he has a weapon with him and then he starts to attack safil khan i would also go on to say remember in many ways a real life hero did become a real life one for his family and for his children karina and the kids were at home at this time the intruder targeted s at least six times two were serious stabbing woods on the neck near the spine and then he managed to flee as well clearly leaving a profusely bleeding and injured sefali khan and the house help hes managed to escape uh for now it appears that not much of details on has he been seen on cctv is there any information on him but the cops believe they have a chain trail and the teams are on it to be tracking i want to go back to my colleagues mustafa and anita brto on that and also remember why this has turned into a political showdown maharashtra government appears to be under fire after an intruder entered into the residence stabbing the actor six times opposition maha vikas aari slamming the bjp for detering law and order even in a porsche area like bandra claiming the attack on on the manner in which it has happened condemning it the ubt senna and congress are demanding answer from the fnav is government and how there are rising attacks against celebrities and stars sanjay rout even went on to say that cops were busy giving security to prime minister modi who was in mumbai a day ago and nobody is safe in maharashtra celebrities are also raising concerns over law and order in the state puja bat actor asked maharashtra govern to strengthen security in bandra remember that this is not just about se ali khan there have been threats to salman khan literally him getting uh the bulletproof windows to his residents at galaxy apartments and the brutal murder of baba sidiki on the streets was considered one of the best in the world one of the best in the world home music al al well have talk continues to be with us on this mustafa why do you think theres a political showdown what are the leaders saying and why are they saying this is not just about se ses residence where the crime has happened what a larger issue go ahead mustafa see uh puja there has been for months issue going on about in a bead area of maharashtra where one serpanch was killed and it was said that the accused had political affiliations and the people have been demanding resignation of dan mund so that is one political angle the other is of of course attack and killing of baba sidiki the other is of course the firing outside salman khans house so even after that uh if we saying that this is a very happening area its not like a farmhouse visage out of country or outskirts of the city so this is something which its a very its a crime which has taken place and raises suspicion because uh its its not like shf khan was walking on the road and he was attacked or there was a theft attempt he was very much inside his house somebody entered somebody attacked him there was a m also present his children were present san tried to save his children he got grievously injured could have lost his life but fortunately has been saved and out of danger and but the accused who did all this managed to escape so you know there will be some political statements coming from the opposition which we are getting to see right now that there are law and order issues in maharashtra so ive given you a background of what has happened but yes it would mumbai police to catch the acc as soon as possible to basically find out the whole f back
54mLuzNdNqs,news today debate celebrities unsafe in mumbai actor saif ali khan in bandra home india today,all right so this evening viewers were going to ask you were going to put out though not the big questions but the unanswered questions that are staring us in the face number one how did the intruder get entry into the house number two how did the attacker escape without guards noticing did the attacker get any insider help the burglary bid a hasty conclusion why would a thief choose such a high risk location and ultimately was it a targeted attack on se ali khan rather than the bugy theory lets uh take these questions to our guest this evening sahil josi our mumbai bureau chief continues to be with us shab de columnist also with us mahesh tap spokesperson ncp sharat paar faction mea chad bor wanker former chief mumbai crime branch sanju wma national spokesperson bjp lets uh cut across immediately right now first to shad because we was there is a sense of fear right now uh that has permeated a lot of people in mumbai and shad is one of them where she does fear that maybe the s are returning in terms of the law and order situation shad in a message posted on x you said appalling and highly disturbing bandra police station doesnt even exist complete breakdown of law and order situation celbs live in dread and fear given this shabby state of affairs baba siddiki murder gunshots outside salman khans house and now sef al khan stabbed is security becoming a concern and let me use a cliche shad for the rich and famous in mumbai what is taken place today has really shaken up the city it is uh indicative of a a crisis in the way we handle law and order in mumbai a bandra which is often referred to as the queen of the suburbs is particularly shaken up because its been a series of attacks within that particular suburb uh on highprofile people salman khan baba sidiki u shah ruk khan a lot of people have been targeted highprofile moneyed business people movie stars and uh it it certainly sends out a strong signal and whoever is sending out that signal we need to know what that signal is and why its being sent out to these people why they being targeted its hard for me to buy the police narrative as it stands today that it was a theft attempt or a burglary attempt uh it looks something far more sinister than that it seems to have been meticulously planned its not that easy to penetrate layers of security for someone like a se al khan walk into a building which has cctv cameras u maybe hide out for many hours wait for the right moment when he and his family are most vulnerable in the middle of the night in the morning and stage such an audacious and bold and brazen attack its really completely defeats me how we are supposed to accept as citizens that this is just one of those incidents that are happening in a mega city sanma would you want to weigh on that because uh there seems to be a sense of fear right now and whether or not you know the ncrb data suggests it or not but if there is a series of incidents that they have been in bandra alone uh you know be it shai sikis murder be it gunshots right outside salman khans house and now this incident the larger question of law and order and security will crop up if it can happen to a ali khan it can happen to anybody you know uh pry first and foremost uh my uh sincere uh you know wishes to sef alik khan and his family members uh and i really want to tell them that uh the mumbai police is doing all it can to ensure uh that the culprit is naed uh the first visuals are uh available uh you know thanks to the cctv footage ill beat one cctv footage which has been recovered uh but you know uh while this may sound cliche i agree with shade uh the burglary attempt uh you know was audacious bold and brazen uh but to second guess the uh mumbai police constabulary and assume that this was not merely a burglary attempt gone wrong but something more sinister in the making i think that would be a bit too presumptuous at this stage because let the police let the police uh you know uh do the needful uh and while as citizens we have every right to question the government of the day uh i think in sensitive matters such as these especially when it uh concerns uh you know uh celebrities uh i think we need to be a little more uh discreet in jumping to uh you know conclusions and i would just like to reinforce what dendra fadnavis uh both in his capacity as the chief minister and the home minister said he said it is an unfortunate incident but it would be incorrect to call mumbai unsafe mumbai is still amongst the safest metropolises in the country and the police are investigating the incident and will leave no stone unturned to ensure that m des justice you know one incident in one highrise where yes its a celebrity in question doesnt make an entire city unsafe is the charge mahesh tab say why politicize an incident of uh which is still you know theres still an investigation on in that first of all im not here to politicize any incidents i sincerely pray that every word that honorable chief minister has spoken comes out true all the mumbai the rest of the state of maharashtra and the country remains safe for everybody not only celebrities and politicians but the arm admy should be safe so i sincerely wish whatever the cm has said in his statement should come out as the truth and im sure that mumbai will bounce back towards safety but at the same time we have got three four such dangerous incidents you know shooting and firing at salman khans residence baba siddiki shot and uh you know outside his sons office and now he s house burglar and in the middle of the night so all these thing definitely have made all of us panic i here we have got a very nice forum at the moment very eminent people on the forum and everybody is scared i mean if this the nawab is not safe then who else is safe in the city of mumbai thats simple question that i mean anybody would want to ask and what is wrong in asking that all right let me also bring in uh you know kunal kohi hes a filmmaker hes actually worked with se ali khan kunal kohi today there are a way too many unanswered questions and then of course there is this fear factor how much does one address that fear factor does this does this you know do we look at it as a load incident or something which is bigger and now bothering especially uh you know i ill use the cliche again the rich and famous where mumbais concern uh id like to step away from um the politicization of this incident uh mumbai has always been a safe city it has always been uh very secure i live in bandra a stones throw away from where sef lives there are no reported burglaries if there were uh we would have been made aware of it and people would have said you know what be careful there are burglaries going on uh none of that has happened there are no uh incidents of burglaries happening so i think uh we should put aside all the politics and everyone should focus their energies on trying to find out how exactly this happened and why exactly it happened that is very important uh because this is a very planned activity a planned action he knew where he was going whose house he was entering why he was entering there it it was all planned you do not just walk into uh a house like that which is on a top floor of a highrise building this is not a ground floor or a first floor or a bungalow where you can just scale a wall and walk in no this is on a very high flor law so all these questions have to be answered and i trust mumbai police mumbai police is one of the best police forces in the world and i uh totally trust them i uh trust the government im sure they will get to the bottom of this our honorable chief minister dendra fnav g has come on camera and said that hes going to take action im sure he will but i think the questions that need to be answered is are how did this guy get in and what was his reason for trying to get in those are the things lets not divert from that because in there there havent been if you go through all the all the police reports of the last few weeks there have not been burglaries in bandra one uh incident that has happened cannot just happen in se ali khans house and its not just sef ali khans house karina kapoor herself is a very big personality they have their own security every building has their own security how are all these securities broken and entered without any uh signs of a breakin so i think that needs to be focused on and lets not please get into a blame game with leave the blame game aside kunal i want to bring in mira chadra banker but mr kohy let me ask you a question you worked closely with sef and there are a lot of people not just fans but wellwishers uh who want to know how how is sef doing the time where we need to leave the family alone see what what has happened is a child has seen his father being attacked a mother has seen her husband and her child being attacked okay theyve been through this trauma it is a very severe trauma for any child to go through let us give them the space let us give them their space and let us give the mumbai police the space to investigate the matter obviously they are going to be very traumatized by this not just today for a long time to come its a very major incident for a yearold child and a sixyearold child to see their father being attacked in their house but how is seth doing right is he well everything completely fine uh and he uh you know held his own and he protected his family i mean hats off to say for that brilliant uh action by him and presence of mind and and attacking god knows what could have happened but i think we need to understand and not speculate lets not speculate on anything there should be you know i want to bring in banker but the only question id ask you is is he is he is he well is sef well because we know hes been moved to the icu hes recuperating yes the doctors have said that he is recovering and uh lets keep it at that and he is recovering and thats thats one thing that everyone is is uh happy about and relieved with that hes uh recovering and recovering well so uh prayers with the family and him that he recovers well hes a very brave man uh hes tough hes fit so obviously hes been so his recovery will be better well yeah lets just hope that happens uh and our prayers with him and the family uh miss banker you know getting you into all of this youve been the former chief youve been the mumbai crime branch and possibly at a time where crime was rif in mumbai miss banker the question that ill ask you now is with what we see are we going back to the s or is it just too much fe your mongering one or two loan incidents really doesnt you know make or create a scenario that once again we are back into the gangs of mumbai days no no i dont agree that we are back into s and i also agree that we need not speculate we must give time to mumbai police im very confident within hours this case will be detected but i want to flag two issues one of your guest panelist did say so much of police force police staff is being used for vip securities so we are not able to do beat petring we are not able to secure an ordinary citizen one that second you know maharashtra state of maharashtra spends less than on its full so we are we lack technology we lack manpower this case will definitely be detected but citizens and all the guest speakers here today or your panelists must continue to pressurize politicians and political leadership to invest in the technology and in manpower human resources of police we also should not discuss where the children have been shifted to these kinds of indiscretions should be avoided you know fair point sah i want to bring you in before we go back to m shobhad what is it and you know what are the leads that the mumbai crime branch is actually working on right now because the accused in this case the perpetrator who we believe you know in these images is still at large we dont know where he is number one number two was this a targeted attack or was it just a random burglary what are the angles that the mumbai police is exploring see right now the case if you look at the fi the case has been registered under sections of uh deco uh using a sharp object uh and also uh deco and deadly weapon and trespassing these are the charges which has been uh sections which has been used in the f there is no section of attempt to murder which is as per bnss now it is its not uh crpc but interestingly uh what im hearing at this point of time is that the mumbai police believes that the person might be history sheeter so there is a possibility that this person must be having some uh past cases against him uh similar kind of a cases possibly uh because the kind of attack he have uh he he did on sef ali khan six times he stabbed him out of that four times uh they call it a puncture that that he actually uh stabbed him inside uh his body using this sharp weapon and there are two cuts on his hand and uh uh one on his uh arm so so so that clearly shows that the man had an intent uh to become deadly and he tried to do that uh secondly now mumbai police has identified the man right now uh they have they are saying that nobody from the house knows him uh so it has it has been mentioned unidentified man entered in the house and uh tried to was involved in a decoy and uh its a a failed de attempt because sef alik khan and other people tried to stop him and then he attacked them uh but they are searching for him there are eight teams which have been formed by the crime branch uh the crime units uh of uh the bandra police station and then they have been searching for him but its its its its taking little bit uh long because the cctv footage but what we have shown is of uh at a time of am and uh the the statement of uh sa ali khans made who actually saw him first has clearly mentioned that she got up at around am in the morning and noticed that there is something happening in the in the house she heard some noises and thats how he she understood that uh there is a burglary attempt inside the house so uh after the man has left the building without being noticed and then uh uh its been more almost hours that uh the police is now searching for him so uh right now uh theyre trying to understand where the man has gone uh the statement have been taken they are waiting for uh time to take uh statement from se alik khan because that will also be needed and uh then rest of the investigation will happen prey all right you know sha de we just you heard kunal kohi there hes a part of the same industry that is being repeatedly targeted be it baba sidiki or uh uh you know the gunshots heard outside salman khans building or the attack on sef ali khan and he says that listen you know this is one off incident mumbai is still very very safe and he has full trust in the system however you earlier on when you said you mentioned the flight of uh you know high net worth individuals abroad do you think the government now needs to take measures to restore public confidence all these incidents impact brand mumbai of what it has been a city considered to be the safest amongst the country well right now you know this is what our dendra fnav has called it he said its one of the safest cities among the mega cities of uh of india here uh on thats thats thats a wonderful statement to make but its not a statement that a lot of people are buying into given what has happened is been a series of attacks is not an isolated attack so for for him to say that he is to ensure that we feel that level of safety that hes hes telling us hes claiming uh we exists and is in place we do not feel safe if se ali khanan can be so easily targeted what about the rest of us people are are insecure particularly people in the suburbs in bandra who live with this daily fear of they they dont know what exactly is going on is it is it some kind of a gang war thats likely to break out as m mumbai has been rocked in the past uh are there people outside nonstate actors who are manipulating mumbai and making sure that they destabilize the the financial capital of india are they scaring people off from investing in this city uh is it just about land grab is it about builders lobbies sending out messages to people who are in positions of power that you either to our line behave or the same fates that happened that whatever happened to se alik khan is likely to be on you these are the things we need to look at more deeply and the police the home department and the chief minister needs to speak to the people of of mumbai today they dont have to wait they dont have going that question a bjp spokesperson but do you think its a you know u its youre being quick to suggest that the theory of burglary attempt would be a hasty conclusion with you know what i uh infer from what youve said now you seem to fear that this was actually a targeted attack at se ali khan is it too early to reach that conclusion is my question you i i simply do not buy this theory of a theft or burglary happening this easily in a in a building that has so many layers of security and uh i i find it hard to accept at face value the police version that it was attempted theft it could be something far more sinister and uh yes its irresponsible to you know put out theories which cant be substantiated at this point uh the only good thing about it is that se ali khan was able to defend himself against this socalled intruder uh they tried to first say it could be an inside job if it was an inside job its not that tough to pick up whoever it was they believe was an insider who had targeted uh se ali khan so i think well have to wait for a couple of days to make the connections and join the dots it does not seem to me uh something that has happen happened in isolation it seems like a much bigger plan to in some ways uh terrorize the movie people terrorize it it has happened in the past there is something a foot there which we need to investigate more thoroughly to send out a strong signal to vulnerable targets particularly in bandra the movie stars and the business people that maybe the in this place is no longer safe for all of you uh maybe mumbai is not the right place for all of you well this is where they live this is where theyve made their mark this is where theyve got everything that they own today is because of mumbai and their professional commitments in this city so if the signal is to get out of mumbai its uh something that i find extremely alarming because it will send out exactly that kind of signal to a lot of people who may not be as high profile but certainly equally vulnerable that if mumbai is not a safe place for people to function in and and theyre almost being pushed out of the city like a lot of highprofile people are looking at plan b which is you know some of the neighboring destinations like dubai and uh spending a minimal time in the city coming in and out just for work it says something really quite shocking about the breakdown in the law and order situation and im sorry but uh uh the owners has to be taken by the police and the home department and the chief minister needs to assure the people of maharashtra and mumbai in particular and bandra even more particular okay that things are not uh as as scary as sinister as most of us believe they actually are no you know thats thats disconcerting to hear because if this is the kind of sentiment sanjua that uh im not saying all because yes you have a kunal kohi who said this is a oneoff and that needs to be investigated and we have full faith but if this is the kind of sentiment that does prevail in a certain section of a mumbiker today no matter what you know uh society or rang of society he comes from then it needs to be given credence too where like miss day is saying that possibly the chief minister the home minister needs to you know come out and al those fears and do it uh you know concertedly other than just you know brushing it off and saying its okay its a oneoff incident you know pry first and foremost let me reiterate that nobodys trying to brush things under the carpet at the same time you know i agree with kunal kohi when he says that this is not the time to speculate is this incident something that is rather unfortunate could it have been avoided avoided perhaps yes is it an insider job well find out uh you know uh was this an organized attempt by an organized mafia or was this just a oneoff lone wolf incident we will find out but i think for anybody ive been a mumbiker for donkey years but for any want to be sitting on national television and waxing eloquent on the one hand saying lets not second guess the mumbai police lets not jump to uh conclusions lets not speculate and in the same way and in the same breath then saying that you know uh mumbai is increasingly becoming unsafe i think that is carrying things a bit too far and being presumptuous because at this time while the mumbai police and the state government needs to be held accountable by all means ive always said lets not digress and deflect from the moot issues at hand when it comes to larger issues pertaining to safety and security of a citizenry having said that i think let the police do its job dont keep second guessing them and saying that organized mafia you know i think these kind of brazenly irresponsible and reckless statements do little good to the situation and at hand point number one and point number two let me just remind i did not want to politicize this and i think this unfortunate incident is not something that can be endorsed by me rattling of data national television but for whatever it is worth lets not forget that in all the way till when udav takre was the chief minister your audience needs to listen to this you know when it came to conviction of heinous crimes including sexual assault on women attempt to murder and murder the conviction rate had fallen to an abysmal low of and today that stands at a healthy i always maintain enough can never be enough when it comes to ensuring you know a fair point but theyre always run down thece can you just hold your horses for a bit all im saying is dont try to run down the police you know they also need a support and yes let me tell you in the last one year alone more than cctvs have been put up in mumbai more than in tan more than in bandi so the government is not keeping as someone would like us to believe all right i want to bring in mahes thsi and all of this because you know the data that sanjua gave up there are always two sides to the data as well sanju verma and youll appreciate this as well because mahes tab say its always good to ask for accountability from your leaders especially those in power you know i strongly believe that but sometimes you need to also understand the situation and read the room and possibly it might be a little too presumptuous to hold those accountable and saying that you know if we are seeing a go back to the s right now its going to be gangs again in mumbai because look at the data the same data that sanju vera quoted and ill quote part of the data and we can put it out there from to mahesh tab say there has been an marginal drop in the murder cases in mumbai there hasnt been an increase so while you have some highprofile places which are staring us in the face the data in terms of crime in mumbai doesnt seem to suggest that we are seeing this burst of crime well let me tell you again that i am not here to politicize it okay like any other panelist who stays in mumbai i also stay in the mm region and i want to safe city not only for myself for my children and for the for everybody for that for the whole but uh yes despite the cctvs despite whatever law and order machinary being revamped and new funds and probably everything we saw baba sidik what happened to baba siddiki we saw firing at salmans resident we also saw whats happened at ss house so that does not absolve us from our responsibility us means im saying the government as such we are also part of the government as active opposition every citizen is part of the government it is a d government is duty bound to protect the lives of it citizen irrespective of his stature cority does not matter just normal man the government has to protect his life and so hence yes there was a marginal drop and thats very appreciable its i think the bombay police record show about drop in crime rate in if im not wrong so i also have some statistics but that does not again say what has happened why celebrities are being targeted why high profile people are being targeted is there design what is wrong to interpret that why cant i mean im sure that the police department we have got mi shes a very ill bring her back officer im sure that they are thinking on those lines we are probably we are missing some we are are we missing certain meaning we sitting on this panel are we missing the meaning maybe the police department the c department the intelligence bank let me ask let me let me get miss mira banker back into this conversation are we you know missing the woods from the trees is there a larger picture miss banker that is being woven where mumbai is concerned while we are focused on these dat you know data figures of crime and seemingly has fallen down is it like you know m shad also articulated that theres a sense of fear theres a sense of deep concern where it comes down to the rich and famous of mumbai sense of concern i accept sense of fear i do not accept and yes as professional police officers we also analyze the trends and if celebrities are being targeted please dont think think that we are not aware of it we are not following it up we are following it up but give us time and lets not ourselves become fear mongers i feel mumbai still continues to be one of the safest city i feel we have highly professional police force and very dedicated officers just give them this time they will find out the pattern as well as this particular case also all right okay miss day you know the mumbai police consider and you know to be one of the most professional law enforcement agency in the country they controlled the underworld menace put an end to gang wars earlier can you trust them to do their job im sure the mumbai police can do it if they want to because we have some of the absolutely top brains in the mumbai police weve always been very very proud of our uh police force uh theyve had dynamic commissioners in the past who have assured the city that uh you know nothing terrible is going to happen so long as they are there to maintain law and order that confidence is definitely shaken but im sure the police uh will do what is required but more importantly its uh the concern for a lot of people is who are the police actually who are they reporting to are they reporting to the public are they responsible to the public or are they following the orders of political bosses are there political games at play here that the average citizen would not even be aware of are we the victims of uh political infighting are we the victims of political uh maneuvering and manipulating of our police force the minute a police force gets compromised and starts reporting to their political bosses then the city is in trouble and i think thats the biggest fear that mumbai is at the moment experience you know uh miss banker the fact is mumbai has always seen a very active uh citizenry and uh theyve always asked questions especially when it comes down uh to those in power would you reckon that this should be welcome that uh you know questions need to be asked especially in this case because if you look at it till now yes its not even been hours but the perpetrator of the crime the accused is still at large and there are more unanswered questions then there are answers absolutely questions are most welcome in fact citizens should help us and take us out of the shikanja of politicians the way we fight for the who will hold the home department that shows how keenly invested politicians are in h in managing police to their what they want so i would say citizens should not only speak they should help and they should help us get autonomy which indian police mumbai police and all state police need very badly you know thats a great uh one to end with but uh sanju verma you want to come in please make your point and ill go back to the ncp spokesperson as well you know prti i have tremendous respect for mea g her track record is out in the public domain uh you know where i humbly disagree with her i think in fact politicians need to be invested in the law and order machinery we need to have empowered civilians we need to have an empowered police constabulary we need to have right san minded politicians who are willing to be held accountable and who are invested in the judicial process in the law of the land in the home ministry i mean why should politicians not be invested in the uh you know judicial process and in uring law and order because finally that is what theyve been voted for and i say this despite being a politician myself i say hold a gun to my head make me accountable let questions be asked of me but at the same time lets not engage in reckless you know uh games related to making seconds im going to close then seconds make your i just want to say that this kind of an incidence has left a deep impact on everybodys mind we all feel that police should be given a free hand to nab and put a full stop i saying full stop to this kind of a activity which is happening in and around mumbai region whether its high profile or low profile irrespective of that whether its a drug pedaling happening in near schools and colleges give the police free hand let them put a full stop full stop me full stop dont ask them any questions stop protecting those mlas and all for the time being let their forces go let the police do the policing job there see you need to have some kind of fear of the system i mean theres no fear okay miss miss banker you know i know youve i want to just bring in miss banker for a quick seconds before we close the show you know youve headed the crime branch in mumbai therefore i want to ask you whats your hunch miss banker what do you think happened here its what i can say that its not run of the mil cas but i would not like to speculate further and yes i am with all of us that police must be given autonomy and free hand not only for politicians and vips but for an ordinary citizens of mumbai and the country all right okay were going to end it on that uh viewers i would reckon lets not get into conspiracy theories just yet uh let this case unfold and see what exactly happened until then um accord the y that the family of se ali khan and karina kapur have requested for uh we wish him a speedy recovery and uh even though most of us still stunned on what really happened

ZFvtBQQp4MU,bollywood facing its biggest crisis due to boycott trends era of superstars over news today,so lets raise the big questions on the bollywood round table is bollywood now an industry in crisis will uh hindi cinema ever be the same again is the era of the superstar blockbuster film simply over is the challenge one of content or of changing business models and are social media boycotts really hurting cinema and film joining me now tonight are uh suar bas who i recorded earlier bavna somaya leading film critic former film editor tanuj gar is a film producer akay rti is a film distributor and exhibitor bat dbar is ad guru and theater professional and playright and im also joined by l shras and senior film journalist i appreciate all of you joining us well try and bring in as many aspects as possible uh ive got at the moment swar basar who as i said i recorded earlier and i asked sar because her film uh uh is also releasing shortly sar normally before a film releases you have jitters about whether the box office will accept it or not now whether its brahmastra or your film it seems the jitters are about whether social media will boycott it that seems to be the new buzz in bollywood how seriously should we take these social media calls to boycott films and you particularly have been targeted at times you know sir youre absolutely bang on that it seems like suddenly now the new uh judges uh who will sit in judgment on films and how they are is this sort of uh unnamed kind of what i like to call the bringdown bollywood brigade um who they are what they are what their agenda is is sometimes not necessarily clear sometimes they themselves make it very obvious and the kind of things theyre saying the kind of accusations and the hysteria theyre trying to whip up around bollywood um i personally feel that the hype and the noise is more than the real bite um i know that there is this perception that l singh chadha and rakshabandhan did not do the expected numbers at the box office because of the social media boycott but i think industry insiders and trade experts will tell you that thats not necessarily entirely true the numbers dont always kind of um add up to that uh there was yes the these trends are nuisance uh in a perception sensitive industry like bollywood but can they turn a film into an and and cause a crash at the box office uh res uh returns i dont think so i mean lets remember that you know weve talked a lot about rab bandhan and uh l singh chadha not performing at the box office there four hindi films that were legit hits this year gangu kwadi bulbulaya jug jug gio and um aan returns and both are and karan johar have for the last two years been trolled because of in the aftermath of the in the aftermath of the suan singh rajput suicide uh theyve both of them have been trolled their films have been trolled they were boycott campaigns and it didnt necessarily work so i think that you know the thing with the boycott is that the noise is a lot yeah its not pleasant its not nice for a marketing team or the pr team or the producer of a film to have to deal with this kind of boycott nonsense before the release but i can tell you that the same thing happened with v wedding in with my film uh because because and and it was centered around me and boycotting the film and the film made more than crores worldwide it was the highest opening film for the quarter uh and it made it was the highest grossing film for that quarter as well and it was a super hit so um yeah i i think that we are you know the the fear is and the hype and the hysteria is more than the real necessarily the numbers i dont know that the number but where does this hype and hysteria come from uh uh s you believe as you mentioned susant singh rajputs death for a moment there was that the turning point suddenly a number of people felt bollywood was a terrible place to be in where there was drug abuse where people are getting depressed whether is nepotism did did that in change anything and make uh people like you possibly more vulnerable in a way because you are outspoken well i think i think definitely there two things one that suan singh rajput suicide created this kind of crazy hysteria that and im sorry to say this on an electronic media channel but that i think that the mainstream electronic media kind of picked up in a really irresponsible manner they whipped up a hysteria around it they whipped up really irresponsible conspiracy theories around it weve seen the fallout of that in terms of what happened with ria the fact that she went to jail the kind of you know demand for mob justice that that came around that thats one aspect of it and that whole susan singh rajput suicide thing has become like a bit of a cult you know the crazy conspiracies like that kind of circulate on that so i i i really dont understand who those people are or what that that agenda is the other thing im sorry to say is that you know there is there is an agenda as far as targeting bollywood goes because bollywood is um you know an industry that is one of the most popular symbols the most popular expressions and the most popular vehicles for indias secularism for our diversity uh its an industry that has always been secular not just in terms of the content that we have made for the larger part of our more than y year history for the kind of philosophy that its put out its a film industry that has stood very strongly for the values of our indian constitution whether its the spirit of secularism whether its the spirit of fraternity whether its the spirit of equality the kind of stories that you tell uh any love story will always you know push the idea that love is greater than soal divide uh love is greater than the divides of past and class and language and religion and um you know its an industry that has a very high representation of our minorities our linguistic identities our ethnic identities our religious identities our cast identities look at the credits of any film to date youll find almost every religious linguistic ethnic uh regional cast identity represented so the people in this country who dont like indias diversity obviously hate bollywood right right and and because bollywood is so popular uh if you want to discredit indias diversity if you want to discredit indian secularism if you want to spin conspiracy theories about indian secularism your first target has to be the most popular symbol and the most popular vehicle for that secular message you know sar is setting up the debate her new film is jarar and well have more of her later but uh who wants to dive in tanu you want to respond to that do you believe that uh bollywood is is being threatened by those who in a way uh uh feel that bollywood represents as swar claims diversity but weve heard voices claiming that bollywood is antihindu that bollywood is actually a space where uh uh theres nepotism there theres a dark underbelly and now people are reacting and therefore cinema is facing these challenges do you do you go go by that look at brahmastra because uh ranir kapoor allegedly in an interview said that he liked beef people want to boy the film should we be taking all this seriously not at all raj firstly we need to understand that p te uh who are trolls trolls are essentially pid teex and nerds uh whose job it is to affect the perception of a film you know or its actors or its filmmakers because someone the mix does to a particular political ideology or a narrative right um a film or an actor that challenges um the political narrative gets trolled in fact even critics arent spar these days right if they ill review a film which is a favorite of the troll factories even they get trolled thats the irony so i completely second what sar is saying i think um theres way too much hype theres way too much noise around these troll factories um i absolutely disagree when people attribute the failure of a film uh to trolling i think thats just delusional thats wrong because i think we need to give the audience um some credit here i think much of our audience has really smartened up the very evolved theyre educated theyre aware uh theyre not going to abandon watching a film just because there are some boycott calls on twitter right okay im going to stop you for a moment because were going to try and get your uh audio link fixed in a moment weve got a bit of what you said ive understood where youre coming from tan let let me bring in bna somaya as well bna youre hearing two views those who are saying these trolls may make a lot of noise call for boycotts of film brahmastra being the latest but they dont decide the fate of a film however but the fact is several major films l singh chadda raksha bandan have all flopped in recent time is it to be blamed on trolls or just that that star system is breaking down people have more options business models are changing postco people dont want to go to the cinemas maybe things are changing in other ways and bollywood is not changing fast enough bollywood uh first and foremost we should stop referring to it as bollywood because now everything is pan india movies and i dont think um a any boycots or any protest can change the fate of a film if the film is good people are going to watch it m uh i think its just become now a drawing room discussion for everybody that oh movies are not working the superstars are not working uh we need to think about whats going wrong this has always happened after every few years there has been a kind of a decline at the box office where the filmmakers the actors need to think rethink uh reinvent themselves uh repackage their movies and reflect about what they ought to be giving to the audience so is the star is the star system though breaking down this idea that you know the big stars the salans the amir the shuk would pull films only on their star appeal is that changing because audiences now have many more options you know you can watch stuff on youtube you can do ot you can what you have very very different options uh i think uh the stars are themselves at an age where they are going to be redefining themselves because they are our superstar male heroes are all plus so there is a kind of a paradigm shift that happens in the kind of roles that they have to choose but star system changing see we have been talking about the studios coming yashraj has been talking whenever i used to meet yash chopra used to say that my movies should be watched because of my banner and not because particular star so that is ultimately what all filmmakers aspire for that v shantaram film should be watched for his band and a yash film should be watched for their banner industry needs to adjust to this changing world aay youre a youre a film distributor exhibitor is there too much of pressure in a way on these big budget films to deliver you know theres still far far too much is spent on the actors the kind of salaries that the actors get or the kind of cost that you spend just in having an amir or a shahruk or a salman im giving the three kh again and again but even an akshay kumar therefore bollywood needs to change its economics dont blame the trolls for boycotting films they will do what they want bollywood needs to look inwards change the economics of film making raj i guess the proof of the pudding is in the eating and were talking about this we debating this on a friday when the movie that we just spoke about which is brahmastra has released and post the pandemic since the emergence of the industry post the pandemic uh its taken the highest ever opening uh that thats been witnessed since diwali last year when sui released so the collections of brahmasri today out of india alone across languages are going to be close to cr rupees so that clearly dispels the myth that any of these boycott calls or the trolling that happens has a sizable impact on the box office so thats crystal clear and thats been made clear today itself right by the by the audience of our country and talking about the impact of stars on the economic the economics of our movies well absolutely i mean the one thing thats really changed uh curtsy the advent of the pandemic is the fact that weve been so overexposed to our stars or rather the other way around our stars have been so overexposed to us cy this social media and pr blitz greek that theyve been up to that to go and pay money drive to a theater of fine parking through that ruckus buy that ticket and make it worthwhile an experience for you you need to have much more than just a star so its truly going back to what cinema was always an originally meant to be which was a storytellers medium theer the kind of movies that are doing well are doing well more because of the storytelling that is involved in them rather than the presence of an xy z star so thats where we going back and i think theyre great signs because by doing this well again emp power our writers our filmmakers our producers and make it a more collective effort you know towards the success of films rather than them being star dependent vehicles where god forbid a star doesnt continue to be as popular with his or her fans movies start tanking with big budgets so i i think its a good metamorphosis that we witnessing i truly believe that there are great times ahead going up you know youre in a sense saying the story is the king content is king story is the king the writer is the king l shasan you know we are seeing it with southern southern cinema i put up some numbers now of films like kgf or rrr which have sort of created this huge buzz around cinema coming in from the south many are saying they found the formula you know they they have these grand uh they do it on a grand scale or the story is powerful do you believe l shasan whether its a pushpa whether its n rrr kgf the southern cinema world has a few lessons to teach uh uh bollywood or am i is that an exaggeration based on a couple of film being so such big successes no raj i definitely think um there is a learning curve for bollywood here at this point because storytelling and writing uh especially the screenplay the script was very key and is very key in south cinema even if you take a small film right whether its a f film or its a cr film like kgf storytelling is so important and i think um bollywood is now you know catering so much to the multiplex urban young audience that they forgotten what storytelling is about if you look at the cinema of the s and s in hindi you had such fantastic films so i think they really need to go back to the drawing board and look at content and see what is the kind of stories they need to tell that and that that i think they can learn from south cinema you know thats interesting bat d uh your views do you believe that you know what makes or breaks a film the these do you believe these loud social media boycott calls are affecting cinema or not i dont think so i dont think the social media no matter how how strong it is it has any effect on an all india box office collections of a film but as somebody just said i think if the bollywood industry started paying to a writer or what theyre paying to a star i think well make better films because they get paid pittens and stars and directors get all the money and i think that wonkiness that is in bollywood has to be changed because it it all begins with the writer a writer thinks of those characters a writer thinks of how the story should go and if you dont have good writers and they wont be good writers unless you pay them good money why should they write a good film for you if they dont get the kind of money that they should be getting okay and unless that changes and see as i said social media i dont think has a great effect on box office but as we say in advertising bollywood should be sensitive to what they are saying there are signals that are being thrown at them mh and bollywood should be aware that these signals should be taken seriously it may not affect a film or two right no are you saying therefore that a film should not be seen quote unquote as antinational or antihindu as some actors are perceived or some some particular on the other side youve got a kashmir files that did so successfully because it was seen to be in tune with what the government sort of nationalism uh narrative was see finally ill tell you what happen as we say in advertising its your target group if you are targeting a certain section of society or the entire society and if they feel like what you are saying if they feel that the film should be nationalistic then you better make films that are nationalistic you cant go against a public opinion because you are here its a commercial its a its a business model you cant say i believe that i should not do this i dont give a damn what my target group feels target group is the most important thing in any communication whether its a film advertising campaign a theater whatever it is you cannot say my target group feels like this but i dont agree with that you cant do that okay very it doesnt work very interesting because you know this is something i put to sar you know swar these perceptions created around bollywood you have been seen as a left liberal voice do you feel a little more vulnerable as a result before a uh film release as you are outspoken you will be called antinational antihindu does that make you now much more careful about what you say because you could be targeted there could be a call to boycott your film because uh the mood of the nation is very different from what a swar basar may think or a mood of a section of the nation well i mean definitely im vulnerable and im a target but ive been a target for this kind of nonsense for the last you know six years um i think that i am being look i dont want to i know that everyone has this image that oh shes so controversial shes always in a controversy but i mean i dont i dont love it i dont i dont ne i im not seeking it yes im um honest and im frank about my opinions uh and im frank as a citizen of this country as a concerned citizen of this country um its its my right um but i do feel that you know people are getting even if im vulnerable as i am i think that people are realizing now that this is its becoming ridiculous its an agenda i dont know that people are taking it very seriously and uh you know i mean you know everyone knows what the game is really um as far as this film goes janara its a beautiful film about friendship about for you know weve always seen road trip and friendship films in bollywood youve never seen a road trip film that has four married housewives from small indian towns being represented you know people that in a snobbish sort of way are relegated and dismissed as being benjes this is a film where you kind of see how cool and badass and sassy these benjes are socalled benjes and i would just like to tell the bollywood brigade that dude why do you want to you know deny your families your friends your mothers your sisters your aunts a chance to see your own lives their lives on screen so if you you sure you can boycott it but why dont you show the film to your mom and your sister and your girlfriend first and got it theyll theyll thank you you know uh uh that was s but i also have heard aliyah bat recently say bana suay if you dont like me dont watch my film you know she was very clear about it uh that you know she doesnt care about these social boycott calls its its all surround sound uh you know shes had a big hit in uh gangubai this year do you therefore believe that actors also uh do they need to be careful about what they say what you know how they are perceived by audiences is that something that is is new you saw bollywood in a previous era did actors need to be so conscious in the pre social media area now everything that an actor says every sound bite is picked up on social media and made into a controversy see in the olden days raj deep uh there was only the print media then came the electronic media i think the dynamics changed when the digital media came when the social media came and also actors or actresses were hardly uh speaking from public platforms they were not even promoting their films so they never got into trouble unless it was something about their personal lives private lives then probably sometimes it became a scandal and uh the audience decided to uh protest or whatever or there were controversies when the film was very controversial uh then it got into trouble at the sensor board and even though the sensor board passed it when the film was released at the theater for example fire then they uh created ras at the theater and tore the posters and all that right i am against any kind of ban im against any kind of trolling uh people will say and do what they want to but that cannot affect the talent of a person for examples when i was listening to sar and i have been following her work from the time she has come into movies you can say whatever you want about her views but you cannot deny that she is a wonderful actor you give her any role and shes fantastic so it is the actor that matters and when i talk to my neighbors my building people or my family they dont care about what comes in the papers they dont care about what the electronic media says they dont care what is the government stand on which person but is all they want is to see a good movie a good actor a good student you know what i feel sorry yeah sorry we we are building towards a consensus in a way way that content is king people want better you know tanu gar because now you have all these ot platforms out there producing some very you know quality stuff and ive got limited time as a viewer to watch between youtube instagram all the various options i have are filmmakers now much more conscious about the kind of films that they make that youve got to put the writer first the script writer first and as was suggested by someone today on the show pay them more pay them at least half of what you pay the big stars the writer is the new star tanu gar will that ever happen in in bollywood like it happens in western cinema can i speak raj yes yes tan i can speak so raj i can speak for ourselves production house i can speak for a couple of other friends of mine who are producers and i think that shift in terms of paying writers recognizing writers acknowledging ers have happened at least where were concerned uh in fact im not going to take names or mention amounts on this show but i will tell you that some of the amounts or the kind of monies that are being paid to writers uh now are pretty startling you know wr could a writer could a writer be paid could a writer ever be paid even of what a star is paid um as a production house were extremely conscious well depends which star youre talking about or what is the category of star youre talking about but i will tell you that um you know given the amount that the writers were previously paid the kind of money they being paid right now is almost four or five times um you know what to this approach but i can tell you that a lot of the new age younger more evolved production houses are beginning to recognize writers quite actively and aggressively okay we were still having some problem with the audio although i think the the audio is clear the video is a bit of a problem but yes but babna you wanted to step in and say something very quickly i want to add to what tanuj was saying uh we are becoming sensitized towards writers we are giving them the dignity and whatever but its not as if it was not happening in the past in fact even in the past everybody had a writers room and the filmmakers shared their scripts with each other and raj kapur asked bim roy what he thought about it and a bim roy was asking uh k so you know it was far more democratic and nobody stole anybodys ideas today what i feel is that while the young production houses are having good writers and a wr home uh their gaze is becoming limited it is a very incestous group with whom you move around and who are your friends and who are the same age group i feel the writers room must have different age age group a female gaze a male gaze a socially conscious gaze and the film should be dissected at every uh shooting stage okay because when i see a film like liger i wonder if they show it to anybody or they just release it that thats an interesting way youre putting it l is it very different uh in the south is there you know this collaborative exercise being much more conscious of changing audience taste you know is that i saw pushpa i saw kgf two very different films both very successful but it seems a greater variety plurality is now being encouraged in in southern cinema is that a conscious effort a recent effort or has it always been there no rash i think its always been there i think in south cinema if you see there has always been space for new talent a lot of talented young directors um you know are signed on with big production houses uh nayantara for instance whos the biggest you know lady superstar shes called works even with debut on directors if the script is good so i think um you know they spend a lot of time writing and working on scripts and its very very collaborative um even if you see yash is kgf he worked even on the script with prashant ne he gave him his inputs and he said you know i have a certain image and these are certain things which can be done to enhance the image there is lot of collaboration that happens it is not just you know the director who makes the decision right everybody is experienced young talent is encouraged and um you know of course they dont share scripts with others but definitely theres a lot of involvement right from the star to the producer in every movie that happens and i think um uh they take their time in developing the script its not done you know in just six months there are you know several years some of them spend in writing a good script so i think um it is a very collaborative effort but you also need to spend time in getting the script right you know also a lot of this is being discussed postco and aka as a exhibitor distributor has life changed postco that now to bring uh dare i say bums on the seat is much more difficult than it was preo people now think twice unless they really are you know keen on on the movie or the script or the story i they dont want to go to the theater anymore well raj see what certainly happened is this is a process that was that was on the way right what the pandemic has done has only accelerated it and the reason that its happened so suddenly this whole process of clear demarcation about what people want to watch and where do they want to watch it has only has like i said been accelerated greatly and thats why right now we all as an industry sc scambling to figure out whats the way forward to get things right no but what do people want to watch no no aa is there a is there a clarity on what really people want to watch you had a kashmir files which has been a big hit youve got an rrr which has been a big hit this year youve got a bu buou very different films that have been hit and youve got the big flops including akshay kumar amir khan type of big stars their film not working so what really works weve said content works but what else is there something else theres also theres also a business angle to this raj yes when you now two people go to a multiplex cinema and if they two popcorn buckets and two tickets itll cost them about rupees and people are saying the same film will come on a ot platform in about a month or two months so why should i spend unless its some spectacular film like may rastra is right why should i spend rupees watching a film in a theater if i can watch the same film two months later you know sub its a business model also that helps here its an interesting point aa you want to respond quickly to that is that is that a consideration are footfalls falling in general absolutely raj but ill tell you so so i make two points here one about what kind of movies are working three broad categories that really succeed in cinema halls because they differentiate the consumption experience from home viewing one is big screen spectacles so you have kgf and trip rs which have those production values which can only optimally be enjoyed in cinema halls okay the is immersive viewing experiences where elements like d come into play so brahmastra which is released today has very highly skewed preference towards the d format of it versus the d format in terms of the ticket sales right and the third which is a very unique to india factor is the collective viewing experience so whenever theres a you know a great dialogue or a phenomenal action scene people cheering and clapping together and going ap crazy in that cinema is something that adds to the consumption experience so broadly these are the three categories of movies that are really doing very well at cinema halls interesting and having said that i think this whole debate that weve been having about the boycotts and everything else while i completely agree that every indian especially the art fraternity must have that right to express themselves i think its equally important for them to be somewhat sensitive to the social and cultural ethos of this country we need to understand that our people and when i say people i mean the common people have a set of beliefs around their religion around their culture and all of that which they are sensitive towards and the least we can do is be at least respectful and sensitive towards it if not you know kind of as some people would like to believe tan you agree you tan you agree that youve got to be sensitive do you really agree that a filmmaker should be sensitive about religious cultural choices and concerns or not do the film the way he or she wants it to be done uh uh raj i do agree that some degree of sensitivity is required and im not debating that but i think the problem here is way beyond that i think its tragic that the trolls really go after a film only because someone associated with of these trolls right and i think that is the larger issue here so whats happening is producers being forced to resort to some amount of selfcensorship theyre trying to become a little more careful a little so youre saying theres an element of self censorship which is creeping in which is troubling right you know la you wanted you raise your hand you want to respond yeah i was just you know when you were talking about content and what the audience wants i mean if you ask ra raji also he will say i dont know what the audience wants but i believe in a certain story and you know therefore um i you know when he when he was talking about bahubali and rrr it was all about the story um and i think here what matters is a directors vision at the end of the day it has to appeal to everybody from an autoa bala to somebody who is suitable for the multiplex audience it has to connect with all of them and a story like that which is able to connect across classes um is what works with the audience you know its interesting that we now talking about being sensitive to cultural sensibilities uh and and and maybe that can at times lead as tanu just now pointed out to an element of selfcensorship uh swar who as i said i spoke to earlier uh should we should bollywood introspect to that extent or shall we call it hindi cinema introspect look beyond this superstar syndrome or the way films were traditionally made uh where the focus was entirely on the actor usually the male actor uh it happened in the amitab bachan era before that rajesh kanana we can go back to dilip kumar but even with the kh and akay kumar or you know are you worried that films are getting caught in these left versus right tangles on social media and these boycott calls forget all that and just make a good film introspect and just improve the quality of the subjects that youre offering audiences the the the the rightwing attempt to malign bollywood and to damage bollywood is there its real bollywood is under attack by the rightwing i just dont know how successful they are at this moment is what im saying okay so you know uh the these attacks weve decided are are perhaps not going to decide fate of films like brahmastra they will be decided on the basis of possibly film reviews do film reviews make a difference bna somaya as a former film editor do you believe that if if if on friday i say

i5AoqzjlDyU,the rudest kpop idols according to reporters staff,even though many kpop idols are known for being nice and sweet towards their fans and staff some have developed a bad reputation for being rude and difficult to work with the girls day members are kind of notorious for being impolite they faced backlash for the rude way that they acted when they appeared on africa tvs tv in after their appearance online communities claimed that girls day had treated treegun the host of the show really badly there was even a debate about a dumpling conflict bit with hedy and souljin where they used informal speech towards the viewers during the show when toyagoon placed some dumplings on the table in front of the girls sojin moved them under the table and said we dont eat dumplings the two continued their teasing conversation about the dumplings for a few more seconds then the host said that he paid for the dumplings and encouraged the members to enjoy them or he would eat them himself souljin finally put the dumplings on the table but made a comment that the dumplings were free and the host didnt pay for them later souljin removed the wrapping to feed the host a dumpling but she showed disgust and laughed when his lips touched her chopsticks after finishing their meal twegun tried to discuss their latest album but heady questioned why they should talk about it then he can be seen mentioning the groups past struggles and asks who theyre grateful for but the members remain silent except for the sounds of the reading later tuegun tries to imitate a police officer but the members basically ignore him to focus more on eating before that controversy in hedy got into another controversy for her supposedly rude behavior at the melon music awards teddy was caught making fun of beast member the moons speech after the group had received an award longoon thanked the fans for voting for them and promised to become widely known singers while the camera was on hedy she was seen mimicking dongoons gestures and repeating his words mockingly we will do our best to become widely known singers while laughing and joking around with her members she had to apologize but her apology was seen as insincere and it even seemed like she was making fun of the situation so she deleted the apology post even though she has long grown out of it soloist and queen of the first generation of kpop ihori was once accused of having celebrity disease in the past donga ilbo reported that when she was promoting her song minutes in she showed up to a press conference minutes late when she appeared on healing camp she said that she wouldnt even greet or apologize to the staff members so to reporters who were present at the event shut off their cameras to protest her bad behavior she knows better now but back then ihiori started blaming others for her shortcomings going as far as to think im ihori why should i apologize thankfully ihori doesnt behave like that anymore unlike hildi boys s ikwa youngs bad behavior wasnt exactly exposed by any reporters staff or even himself but by a leaked audio message of him making extremely offensive comments about his fans back in an edison claiming to be an exgirlfriend of hui young posted a voice recording of him talking badly about his fans the audio message spread like wildfire on the internet he can be heard saying that he hates being called oba by fans and goes on to say it sucks at high touch sessions you know at those events where we hold our fans hands and greet them we have to greet or people and it makes me want to throw up seriously their breath smell terrible the groups age agency cj e m and liveworks company uploaded an official statement saying that hua young would not appear at one of the groups concerts as he had disappointed fans if you ask some kpop fans red velvets irene is the first idol to come to mind whenever rude behavior comes up as she had a pretty big scandal in when she was called out by a stylist for being incredibly rude to her in october of a veteran fashion editor and stylist khan kukwa made a post on her instagram account sharing her experience working with irene she called irene inhumane accusing her of lacking character the stylist said that she had received warnings about working with her but still remained speechless when irene lushed out on her kukwa said i thought i had let everything go after meeting all kinds of people throughout my years in this industry but i was wrong according to the stylist irene didnt greet the staff and sat in her chair using her phone as she threw a fit to the point that the stylist cried she also went to talk to irene in person so she could receive an honest apology but irene had disappeared however she voice recorded everything just in case and promised to take action even though the stylist didnt name anyone in particular the post caption concluded with the hashtag psycho and monster which corresponded to the titles of songs that irene had worked on that year causing online users to speculate that she was the individual described in the post to make matters worse several notable fashion editors photographers models and former stylists had liked the post furthermore an individual claiming to be an industry insider expressed their support of the editor in the comment section after the incident irene issued an apology on instagram and sm entertainment also issued a statement confirming that she had met with the editor to apologize according to news korea the editor eventually requested that online user stop speculating and stated that the matter had been resolved through a mutual exchange of apologies irene withdrew from public appearances for a while following the controversy but later made a comeback stronger than before and has not been involved in any similar scandal since then zex keys member kong seonghoon was called out for being rude as he was caught talking to fans about how idols nowadays are ugly and have dirty skin a video with the title absurd mark which was posted in spread around pretty quickly as it captured songhun insulting the appearances of idols songhun is seen sitting down with fans casually and having a conversation in which he can be heard wishing he was taller fans told him that he was fine just the way he was which prompted sunghoon to go on iran about how idols look nowadays he says when i see them at shops they are freaking ugly why is that they are freaking ugly freaking their skin is dirty too why are they so ugly then fans asked him to name specific idols and songkun said that there hasnt been a single good looking idol since dolbang shingi then he goes on to say that the bb members were definitely ugly and that when he comes to produce his idols he would choose them based on their looks he said dont you think they should be quite handsome given that theyre celebrities with good skin with some aura no in addition songhan has been criticized for making derogatory remarks about the general public in a live broadcast in while walking outside he made a comment to a passing fruit truck saying dont misunderstand this isnt some street market or something tongdandong is one of the richest neighborhoods and souls so songhun was implying that street markets are inferior to tondong and it belittled the worth and importance of people who work in street markets or frequent them as customers this condescending remark received widespread criticism that even sbs news reported on the incident despite disbanding in zexes managed to reunite in but because of sunkens ongoing involvement in multiple controversies he left the group in rapper dean dean has confessed to having caught the celebrity disease and becoming incredibly rude after he appeared on the popular korean rap competition show show me the money on pop myungsoos radio show he shared that he became arrogant and stopped showing basic manners like bowing his head to his seniors except for when he was washing his own face he also developed a belief that celebrity shouldnt answer calls and as a result refused to pick up calls from his own parents because the fame had gotten to his head thankfully he had people who cared about him and were ready to call him out so after six months of acting like a diva his older brother scolded him and brought him back to his senses take this information with a grain of salt but it is also rumored that the boys members except for julian are very rude to their staff its just rumors but heres what we know according to reports a twitter account allegedly belonging to a staff member of the boys made a critical post about the members the post dated i can see why tuyan is the most popular member of the boys one of the reasons is undoubtedly his looks he seemed comparatively pleasant during their first photo shoot while other members were impolite the post went on to explain that tuyon has always been kind and gentle and compared to other members they went on to say that he comprehends directions faster and doesnt display any signs of annoyance or exhaustion unlike his fellow members netizens were quick to believe the accusations commenting the staff swears that the whole team except for one member i wonder how rude they are and i can feel the staffs anger through the post on another separate occasion the members were criticized about how they were treating a female staff member on july th a youtube channel posted a video titled idol accused of mistreating female employee at luxury department store the video contains several photos reportedly taken out a department store depicting group members shopping with an agency staff member the video claims that the boys member knew was wearing a backpack in front of a luxury store and the staff member was seen carrying the bag later in other photos the staff member can be seen carrying shopping bags for the other members the youtuber claims that the photos were taken at a foreign department store and suggest that such behavior would not be tolerated at a korean department store but none of these claims against the boys were ever confirmed or addressed so its difficult to take them seriously tell us your thoughts in the comments and thank you so much for watching well see you next time bye
gdjNIhpob70,this is how kpop idols date secretly,dating in kpop is a pretty touchy subject since idols have that clean image that seems like they never date and dedicated their whole life to the fans but got ss bam bam have some serious words for you to navigate their many restrictions and prying eyes kpop stars have figured out some crafty ways to date without getting caught lets explore the creative methods as told by themselves and the industry insiders shh its top secret disguise or even crossdressing celebrities have to get pretty crafty when it comes to dating on the down low some go all out with elaborate disguises covering themselves or their significant others so they cant be recognized but one of the best examples has to be super juniors heichel he once shared that he went on a date dressed as a woman just to stay anonymous by dawning a wig and a dress he could walk around holding hands with his date without anyone giving him a second glance its a bold move but it worked some of you probably recognize hechel as the hilarious guy from knowing brothers but in his prime he was considered one of the most stunning male idols out there his stylists often gave him an androgynous look with long hair and makeup which made his crossdressing disguise story all the more convincing theres even this funny story where an ai generated image of heel as a woman tricked some of his celebrity friends they actually asked for her number not realizing it was him and hes not the only super junior member with creative ideas shindong for example took a different approach he used what youd call hidden in plain sight instead of wearing a disguise himself he had his noncelebrity girlfriend pose as his stylist this way they could hang out without anyone suspecting a thing and even when his girlfriend touches him its not weird at all since she is a staff right its really a clever way to stay close with without raising eyebrows stolen moments backstage and secret messages when it comes to celebrities finding discret ways to send messages is like an art form they cant just contact each other out in the open so they have to get creative back in the day during the second to third generation kpop era greeting each other at music shows and exchanging album was the thing to do juniors would visit their seniors dressing rooms to show respect usually bringing along a signed album as a token of appreciation some times though the seniors would surprise the juniors by visiting them first it was a heartwarming gesture but it could also be an opportunity to exchange something a bit more secret on hunman jung lelys ugi shared a story about how a fellow group member received a signed cd from another idol it seemed like a typical autograph but hidden inside was a phone number a sneaky way to get in touch without anyone else noticing former minute member john jun shared on videoar that there are all sorts of hidden spots within korean broadcast st stations where idols can meet without being seen like quiet hallways and rest areas near vending machines it was almost like a scene from a krama secret dating with a sandwich yes you heard that right a sandwich can be a secret dating weapon if youve never heard of the inkyo sandwich you might be new to the kpop scene as we discussed in a previous segment exchanging albums is one of the wellknown methods for exchanging phone numbers however as alex from ria explained this trick is risky because managers often check the albums the only other safe spots for idols to talk or exchange numbers were during camera and mic checks when managers werent watching or when they went to buy food which is a basic need and that is where the sandwich comes into play the sandwich gets its name from the korean music show inky goo which airs onbs every sunday this is where idols gather to perform making it one of the few times so many of them are in the same building at once the cafeteria on the fourth floor of the sbs building was the place to get the sandwich its usually off limits to anyone but artist and staff which made it ideal for a sneaky date plan the sandwich itself is quite a mix potato egg salad strawberry jam cabbage and crabstick col sla between four slices of crustless white bread but it wasnt just the fillings that made it interesting the secret was in how idols would unwrap one end of the sandwich slip in a piece of paper with a phone number then pass it on to the idol they were interested in it was a clever way to connect without drawing too much attention unfortunately the sandwich was discontinued around and many believe its because it was becoming too well known as a dating tool the girl group kepler confirmed it when they mentioned it was no longer available on the sbs menu signaling an end of an era even though the original inkyo sandwich is no longer available kpop idols continue to find other creative ways to date in secret which brings us to the next secret idol star athletic championship the idol star athletic championship hosted by nbc has been a korean entertainment staple for over a decade fans eagerly await this event every holiday season the championship has given us some truly iconic kpop moments like when s dk hit the bullseye in archery four times in a row one of his shots was too precise it broke the camera lens at the center of the target talk about bullseye now what makes this event extra intriguing is that its a gathering point for idols from all corners of the kpop world see seniors juniors rising stars and the hottest stars one of the hosts jan ymu shared on the show happy together while he was hosting the championship alongside super juniors lee tug and shindong they had a front row seat to all the love signals being sent across the field he said that from their vantage point they could see everything like when an idol whos been in the business for a few years starts making lovely eyes at someone else lee tug would lean over and say those two are in it yan m created a lot of laughter when he ended the story by saying itll be a big problem if i open my mouth and say anything more even girls day members confirm this story they joked how they can feel romance in the air during the idol star athletics championship on a show called life bar bar they talked about how you could just feel the flirtation happening during the event as idols exchanged glances and shared little moments while competing its kind of like a big kpop high school reunion with a hint of romance thrown in stylists are their fairy date mother with managers and companies watching their every move and cameras lurking everywhere its tough for idols to interact with people outside their tightknit circles despite all the strict rules theres one group of people who can help idols in their love lives the stylists on the talk show life bar girls days harry explained that stylists and makeup artists often work with multiple idol groups and actors this unique position makes them the perfect middleman when the stars want to connect without attracting attention if an idol is interested in someone from another group they can ask their stylist to help pass messages or even set up a casual meeting using stylist as intermediaries is genius because it doesnt raise any red flags idols already visit stylist shops regularly for makeup and wardrobe adjustments so no one bats an eye when they make extra trips not only the stylist helped idols look their best theyre also the unsung heroes of the little romance behind the scenes discret dates when youre a celebrity you cant just walk into any restaurant or movie theater for a date without causing a scene thats why kpop idols and other stars have to get creative when it comes to discret dates they often choose exclusive venues that offer privacy and sometimes they get a little help from friends in high places hong suuk chun is one of those friends he is a wellknown tv personality and owned several restaurants in soul he shares that his trendy restaurants are a favorite among celebrities because he offers something most places cant privacy mong has a private top floor where stars can dine without being seen and he goes the extra mile to coordinate their arrivals and departures to avoid overlap he even tells them to text him if they need anything to keep their date as lowkey as possible with this level of discretion celebrity couples can enjoy dinner without worrying about paparazzi or overeager fans another classic but discreet date spot the cinema you know those drama scenes where the stars slip into the theater after the movie has already started when the lights are low it actually happens in real life in a kbs show called we like zen an entertainment reporter took super juniors heichel and pristine kul kyung on a behind thescenes tour of a cinema thats popular among top stars for secret dates this cinema has a very strategic entry point that can be accessed from a parking lot in less than minutes which helps maintain anonymity no wonder its a hot spot for lowprofile dates after you buy a ticket you go straight in only only one staff member sees you the reporter explained the cinema staff mentioned that they had seen many celebrities there confirming the validity of this information even more interestingly theres one seat thats particularly popular among celebrities due to its strategic position its located in the very back row far enough from the entrance and theres only two seats in that section giving couples the perfect spot to watch a movie without attracting attention love in plain sight and when all else fails sometimes the best way to keep a date secret is to just act like youre not hiding anything it might sound counterintuitive but meeting in crowded public places can actually help you fly under the radar by blending into the crowd you can enjoy your date without drawing attention in a episode of radio star rainbows kim jagy young shared her clever trick for keeping her dates private while staying out in the open and its pure genius shed go on dates at korean palaces yes the ones with tourists all over the place but shed wear a hanbok which is traditional korean clothing by dressing up like a tourist she could blend in with the crowd and not look out of place its a smart way to stay undercover without looking suspicious she says tourists are usually more interested in the scenery and capturing their own memories than in watching other people so idols can relax and enjoy their date without worrying about getting caught the palace also opens for a night tour making this date idea is even more explorable at night the couple will not attract attention attention even more in the plus side youre definitely dressed to the nines can you imagine getting home from your trip checking your photos and finding out youve been photob bombed by a celebrity couple talk about a fun surprise if you ever happen to spot idols out on a date lets give them some space and let them enjoy their private time now lets dive into the darker side of idol culture where some fans become

that without even glancing at said data and what he saw were images of women unconscious naked videos of unconscious women being essayed women being dred and abused in group chats there were prices under these women the cost of how much it would be to essay them yourself menus literal catalogues of woman for sale messages that depicted people discussing the quote sale of these women they would read like number one doesnt talk that much and kind of loves money she also has aspects where she doesnt have much charisma in drinking scenes but her visuals are great number three good visuals shes bright shes fun while drinking but the negative aspect is she gets a little messy messy when shes drunk but still lot of charisma the receiving end text back then lets go with number five along with number three girls were just being sold to the highest spitter messages showed people sharing videos of unconscious women dred dragged and essayed the receiving parties of these messages they reacted to the videos as if they were watching a funny tik tok something entertaining not a literal crime they would text things like i fed her sleeping pills and assaulted her in the back then in the front then in the back again and then i finished people were responding hahahahaha redacted insert persons name ate him some other people commented the mouth on her is great another chat log showed a picture of a sleeping woman and the friends responded who is it her body is so freaking good another chat included a video of an unconscious woman being essayed with the text who wants to watch explicit videos tonight the friends responded whats this is she unconscious the sender responds and if she is send a video with an alive girl its because shes unconscious i can take these high quality videos with flash someone else in the group chat responds you her he he in another text they write she doesnt even remember who she did it with implying that the drugs they fed the victim altered her memory but someone else responds into the chat no shes just an rw as park is reading some of these messages and glimpsing at some of these pictures he is realizing that there are literal crimes being committed in these group chats women are beinged and essayed he needs to alert the authorities about it this feels like a shady crime syndicate out there running some sort of brothel out of their basement he opens the group chat in full to see what other crimes they had committed and he was shocked to see that he recognized every single contact name in there the phone belonged to a famous korean idol by the name of tong chun yong or jj y he was the lead of a band called jjy band another idol from ft island named choy jong hun e jongan lead vocalist and guitarist of cn blue and the biggest name of all was eing lee from the global group big bang and these messages they revealed a complex traffic king ring operated by some of the biggest names in the korean entertainment industry the chatlogs were between some of the most wellknown beloved celebrities in the industry the wholesome kind of idols like the ones that girls would look at and show their boyfriends and say he would never do this in another group chat the idols joke about how five of them gang essayed a dr woman the night before a fan sign event there was another shocking video of a woman being dragged out of a club owned by eing le by her hair by a man who is about to do god knows what to her and shes trying to desperately get the club employees attention by smacking down their laptop screens as shes getting dragged out by her hair employees dont even look they act like nothing is happening the video was spread through the group chat and so was another one well its a text message and this is the reason why the employee of the data forensic company could never go to the police with these messages a text read i saw the messages between the h and the police chief they found out who snitched even high up police commissioners were exposed to be vip clients of this trafficking ring park had just uncovered a trafficking ring run by celebrities police officials and there was nobody that could help him there was nobody that could save the victims because everyone at the top was dirty but park would secretly make a copy of every every single text message and years later it would be released onto the internet exposing one of the most shocking korean cases to date the burning sun music case we would like to thank todays sponsors who have made it possible for rotten mango to support the joyful

mission to be worthy advocates for these causes and as always full show notes are available at rotten mango podcastcom now burning sun is a case that were revisiting from long long ago because its resurfacing in the news there was a recent scandal that will get into and additionally because i feel like our quality of research has drastically improved so truly this is going to be a deep deep dive onto the horrors of this case because its a lot we had multiple translators researchers help assist with this one there was one rm meeting where we had like seven people in three different time zones just on a call for hours trying to get through everything again were like going through it three times four times just to make sure everything is good but as always if theres anything weve missed or anything that was lost in translation or wasnt properly clarified please let us know in the comments and with that being said lets get started this case took place in korea around but its back in the news cycle for a lot of k nens because of a new picture that was posted to instagram well two pictures well call them picture a and picture b if youre listening to the audio version of this podcast im going to describe both pictures to you picture a show a beautiful private swimming pool from a resort in bali it seems like one of those villas that you can rent and someone took a picture of the private pool in the back the water in the pool is turquoise blue theres beautiful palm trees banana leaf trees surrounding the pool theres this beige cushioned lounge chair next to the pool that you can lay down in and sit in the sun its beautiful it looks expensive which makes it a very typical picture to post on instagram picture b is almost an exact copy of picture a but its not a repost its not like someone stole picture a and pretended im in bali too its a completely new photo it shows more of the villa than the pool from picture a but you can tell its the same exact place two pictures in the same villa in bali so whats the big problem here its a resort in bali of course theres going to be lots of people from all over the world staying there and taking pictures picture a was posted by girl a since they want to remain anonymous in the news picture b was posted by girl b the problem here was they ran in the same circles where it was discovered that they were both dating the same man former kpop star former inmate and owner of the nightclub burning sun eung le and im going to be brief with the scandal that unfolds because theres not too much to it but eung le was cheating on multiple women and taking them on backtack trips with the same exact itinerary so he would ask girl a who thinks shes in a monogamous relationship with him to fly out to bali to see him he would rent a villa take her to very specific restaurants and dates and after days she would fly back to korea and that same day that she leaves bali girl be who also believes that shes in a monogamous relationship with him would fly into bali to see him she would stay in the exact same villa girl a had just left from i mean its likely that girl as perfume sent is still in the villa at this point and he would take girl b on the same exact dates that he had just taken girl a everything is identical he had planned the exact same trip for both girls took them to the same restaurants the same beaches the same hotels the same cafes he didnt even wait hours before both trips it was back to back girl a flies into bali girl a flies out of bali girl b flies into bal girl b flies out of bali and all of this was quote unquote exposed when both girls discovered that they had posted the exact same picture of the villa and they started texting each other about their bali trips the story was sold to dispatch and some neens commented on the scandal i hope the girls dont think that its just girl a through b suly probably has woman a through z i thought he was in jail thats what a lot of people were also saying like what whats going on why are we writing these random cheating articles about a literal criminal whats happen in jail or no hes free hes free out of jail jail he was in jail hes already out he was only in there for and a half years and now hes back to dating yes people already back to yeah being involved with women w a lot of the comments of the same reaction as you i mean they were just shocked they were shocked that he was in the news they were shocked that he was out of prison they were shocked that girls would even go out with him that they would travel all the way to bali to be with him in the first place when his club burning sun was exposed for basically having a trafficking ring operating during club hours yeah how is he only a year and a half thats insane for the level of crime he committed a lot of people actually speculate that this is hungy trying to get back into the industry it sounds counterproductive because why would a cheating scandal be good for him but to have these many scandals that sound like celebrity scandals are probably better than having burning sun as the last scandal and god forbid hes trying to make a comeback like im not even sure how thats possible but just in case thats his end goal let us all refresh our memories of the case of the burning sun what was later dubbed the vip company a young woman named m jong woke up in a bed and her eyes still felt really out of focus thats how she describes this whole feeling is her eyes feel out of focus she tries turning her head to see where she is and she doesnt recognize the room that shes in she doesnt even remember how she got into this room to begin with in fact she doesnt remember much or really anything at all for the past few hours she keeps blinking and trying to reach for any memory of even the last hour theres literally nothing in there and then a man walks into the room she remembers him but before she can act hes on the bed holding her down strangling her shes kicking biting him trying to push off of her but hes way too strong hes simultaneously strangling her with one hand and using the other hand to cover her mouth hes using his body weight to push down on her body she felt like she was going to die every time she tried to get up he pushed her harder down into the bed her neck is bent against the headboard at a dangerous painful angle and she would later say i felt like i was going to die she could not get this man off of her he would proceed to rip off her clothes and essay her each time he pushed her she could feel her neck bending more and more against the headboard she said she felt like her neck was going to snap after this brutal assault she grabs the mini trash can by the bed and she throws up everything that she has in her system the throw up was this dark brown color was blood she said at this point she really really really felt like she was going to die because earlier the focus had been trying to get him off of her but now now that hes off of her she doesnt really know what his plans are mang likely ran through all of the options in her mind she clearly could not fight him off physically so she said she got on her knees on the carpeted floor and begged for her life she was trying to appeal to any sort of humanity or even empathy if he had any really she cried that she just wanted to go home she would never go to the police about this oh my god she just wanted to see her mom thats all she just wanted to see her mom she finally looks up at the man this kidnapper this rapist and he just starts laughing hes giggling at her begging for her life and he responds if you take a selfie with me ill let you go home what what evidence he takes out his phone turns on the front camera grabs m jong and basically forces her to sit on him okay now smile mong doesnt really know what to make of this is he playing a game right now like why would he want to take a picture with her was he really going to let her go she said that she squeezed out a small smile and the man kept his promise he threw her clothes at her face and pushed her out of the room she booked it she didnt even wait to put on her clothes she just ran down the hallway of this hotel building out the main door into the middle of winter in south korea middle of the night pitch black its snowing shes half barefoot but she doesnt feel any of that shes running towards the main road with her shoes and her pants in her hand and this other hand is stretched out trying to flag down the closest taxi she wants to get out of here and as far away from that man as possible because who knows what if he comes back what if he changes his mind thankfully a taxi stops and she gets in frantically she gives her address and when she sees the hotel disappear from sight the fight orf flight that it kicked in it probably finally calmed down because she looks down and realizes shes still naked from the waist down and there was a taxi driver looking at her in the rearview mirror i mean of course we dont know why this man was looking at her it could be that shes naked from the waist down and hes like why is she naked we dont know if he had any sinister intentions i dont think so but she put her clothes over her lap trying to draw the least amount of attention on herself from the taxi driver she tries to take inventory of everything she has she notices she doesnt have her phone credit card or her winter jacket i mean its bad but whats worse is that that shes missing hours in her memory she has no idea how she got to that hotel with the man that she was there with after getting home meong gathers herself as best as she can and goes to the police station she reports the physical and abuse and shows them all of the cuts and bruises on her body she said she wanted aest she knew that she had been i mean this had never happened before her memory had always been fine but now she conveniently has a gap in her memory and ends up at a hotel with a man that viciously essayed her no she was this isnt right she demands a drug test and she knows that this is not only going to prove that he essayed her but heed her in order to do it this was going to convict him it was going to get her justice put that sick man behind bar so that he could never do it again assaulting woman making them beg for their lives before throwing them out onto the street i mean it was despicable shes going to make sure that he gets put away for a long time the drug test comes back there are no drugs in her system what that doesnt make any sense and im sure she could tell that the police were looking at her like she had lost her mind she said the police started treating her like she was a liar like she was a criminal as if shes just making up lies to get back at a man that she slept with and shes wondering why would i do that i mean women dont get anything good out of being a victim of a crime especially in a place like south korea where female victims are constantly shamed why would she make up this kind of lie because the man is chavos rakul lets call him chav he is a wealthy nepo baby of influential thai politicians and he is considered a young businessman but hes honestly just a neppo baby the police were asking m jong with these very patronizing looks on their faces as if they had just caught a kid in a lie so the police knew it was him yeah she was like i know this man let me give you the name of this man i remember this man theyre like are you sure it was really i mean we heard from witnesses that saw you guys at a club together and said that you guys were very close and he is from a wealthy family are you sure that you werent just interested in him and maybe you went back to the hotel with him did something that youre not very proud of mung felt like the police arent even doing a thorough investigation they just saw negative test rich man being accused of must be some sort of gold digging scheme to get money out of the guy mang is like yeah no that doesnt make any sense do you have cctv footage of the hotel reception because i in the hotel lobby i can assure you i did not walk in there willingly technically even if she did willingly walk into the hotel with this man i dont think that means she wasnt assaulted i just want to put that disclaimer out there but shes trying to prove something anything to the police so that they take her seriously which you know they really should have done in the first place but regardless they pull the cctv footage and mja is floored it doesnt make any sense she sees herself walking into the hotel with the man willingly hes not dragging her she doesnt even appear to beed shes walking normally stable shes walking at a leisurely pace if anything shes almost leading the man shes walking in front of the guy shes having an animated conversation with him shes seen on cctv camera of the hotel lobby smiling at the man how is this possible chav is taii but since hes the son of influential politicians hes a celebrity back at home the allegations followed him all the way from south korea to thailand he did some news interviews where he completely denied it all i mean as expected but he even reported feeling sad yeah he said i feel very unlucky to have been swept into a case like this im innocent and i feel that this is all very unfair and as a way of proving his innocence the news channels played the the cctv footage of the two of them walking into the hotel he said when i was going into the hotel she followed me she was conscious the cctv shows it all i didnt use any force or put her over my shoulder or carry her in mang felt like she was going crazy she was being framed as this liar accuser manipulator gold digger i mean they used a lot of eloquent words in the media news outlets but they basically said she found out that he was rich seduced him took a picture with him because she was having fun and now shes turned around and cried rap because she wants his money so the photo was released yeah and that became like something that oh wow chv is like look we had a good time shes smiling does that look like someone whos fearing for her life wow m jong knew that she would never in a million years lie about something like this and you know what there was something odd about the cctv footage sure at first it seems like shes happy to be there but she has zero memory of it and second of all its outside in south korea where is her jacket she remembers wearing a puffer jacket that night but shes not wearing it in the hotel footage so what is she wearing like thin light sweater okay like what youre wearing sweater okay its just very strange shes an adult no one just leaves their jacket out of even if you feel hot you carry her jacket where is her jacket it just isnt something that she would do so she keeps trying to piece together the events of that night and it feels like there are just holes in her memory as if someone had taken a scapel and carved out a section of her memory clean precision she does remember though hours long before the the hotel she was getting dressed up to go with her friends to the burning sun club none of them were really clubgoers like that but they just wanted to see what the hype was about and it really did live up to its reputation they walk in and the club is packed everybodys letting loose enjoying themselves it wasnt one of those like stuffy stuck up environments where everybody is eyeing each other up and down the music is good i mean its loud but its very good everybodys dancing its a nice break from the work and the school she remembered it was it was fun she remembered her friends had all purchased a table they sat down and she offers hey im going to go to the bar and get us all some drinks at the bar she felt this gentle tap on her shoulder turns around and its a man now to give you further context the burning sun is kind of known to be a wattpad club yeah kind of right in the sense that there were some anecdotal reports that women would go to the burning sun run into wealthy young attractive foreign businessmen and start dating them which is just like an innocent cute watpad dream it kind of implied that most men at the burning sun are wellconnected highpowered high n worth individuals that are also kind of attractive so its likely mong was like oh oh my god this is kind of funny its like my own little whatpad moment right the man is tall handsome but more importantly he was a gentleman he kept a respectful distance kept his eyes on her face not her body didnt even try to touch her waist touch her arm while he laughs none of that no physical contact hes kind talkative respectful in this loud busy club with people dancing on each other this tall handsome guy is asking her about her pets and hobbies hes very nice she even joined him in his vip room later to talk about all these mundane things and it was kind of cute and wholesome mean jungs having fun but at the end of the day she is still a girl at a club and that is something that you never really forget so when he offers her her champagne and whiskey shes like oh i dont really drink champagne but ill take some whiskey she takes three shots of whiskey that night im not a big drinker so to me i have no idea how much that is but apparently its not much at all especially if you know your limits which mean j it she knew that three shots of whiskey would not even make her tipsy maybe on an empty stomach but she ate dinner before she came i mean it was just it was nothing and she didnt even take the shots back to back shes not slamming it down shes careful she spaces them out drinking water in between she even told the guy straight up hey im not really fond of being drunk so im just going to take it easy tonight he was so nice about it he kept pouring her glasses of water and sliding in front of her here drink the water since you dont want to get drunk it helps she thanked him and they continued on with their conversation until she felt this out of body almost a floating sensation mid conversation her eyes go fuzzy she was trying to be polite and focus on what what this man is saying but its like her eyes were out of focus camera lenses she tries wiping her eyes discreetly blinking but even her brain starts to feel fuzzy it feels like she had been drinking heavily all night long but that doesnt make any sense because she had been so careful not to get drunk she had even been taking just glasses of water in between her shots of whiskey she tries to rub her eyes again but she said that her hands were not coming up to her face now she tries to move even just one finger nothings moving its kind of like sleep paralysis where you cant even move though you try really really hard and even with something like sleep paralysis theres this strong level of panic associated with that feeling of not having control over your body but imagine that experience at a club with a bunch of strangers im sure its a different level of confusion stress anxiety panic her body was no longer responding to her brain the man that she had been talking to still going on and on about how you had a flight scheduled tomorrow to go back to thailand and hes just fading into this big blur and she heard his voice through it all and it felt like she was listening from a completely different dimension it sounded very distorted she heard him say so you have to make me happy today and thats it she doesnt remember anything else after that just waking up in that bed to be assaulted she knew she wasnt going crazy even though everyone including the police are trying to convince her that shes going crazy shes thinking i must have beened and she had a sneaking suspicion that something was in the water at burning sun and water is a big business at burning sun the employees of burning sun are incentivized to bring vips water to procure good water and protect the vips water and deliver good water to the vip tables and rooms if the employees were capable of doing that some of them would make close to in a single night from tips from vips wow all all from the big shot forign vip clients that are really really happy about water the employees of the club would work together as a team to make sure vip customers got their water they would even have group chats in real time while theyre working about how things were going how the vips were looking for water how they are enjoying their water who needs more water they would text things like the vip in the room is looking for good water tonight okay im looking for good water hurry hes pestering me for water hes very thirsty he said it doesnt even need to be good water anymore just someone get him some water his fellow cooworker responds ill get him a side dish then little confusing in another chat an employee texts the other employees someone is approaching the water i secured for a vip bouncer hurry up and go protect my water he gets a response from the bouncer on it the bouncer pushes through the crowd towards the bar scanning the area he spots the water that the employee is talking about a man is with the water water so he approaches this man tells him to get lost and hes standing there awkwardly with the water but its not what you imagine its not a cup of water its not a bottle of water its a woman shes very pretty she would make the vips very happy employees at the burning sun had their own vocabulary when they were working when they say water they were never talking about real water they were talking about women female clubgoers thats what they call them not humans not people not women water so in korean like mo mo yeah its like a phrase that you would use if you go outside and you see a ton of pretty people that day you might say something along the lines of wow why is the water so fresh today thats a way of saying wow everyone is so attractive today because the slang is the water is fresh means the fish in the water is fresh and tasty water can refer to all genders when its used in this phrase like when people say the water is fresh its not just referring to women it could mean oh the guys are attractive like everybodys attractive okay i sometimes im lurking in my instagram comments and i see that a lot of you guys have businesses and i

sun water refers to women good water refers to very pretty women and averagely okay women are just side dishes they are not the main course the goal for the employees at the burning sun is to survey the women coming into the club pick the prettiest ones that would please the vips get them drunk them before the vip get there so they can deliver them to the vip the goal would be she is beautiful she is beyond the point of consent the vip is happy because now the vip doesnt have to waste his time getting her drunk so that he can essay her he can just go ahead and do whatever he wants to her illegally vip is happy the employees get a big tip that is the ultimate goal of the employees at burning sun and nothing makes them happier than watching the little essay of a young woman they would text videos go into their group chat of vips are wording unconscious woman they would text things like look at the vip room right now theyre doing
ADdvMNZqlPc,kpop idols who got into dating rumors recently,from to blackpink is a big year for dating rumors the most recent dating rumor involves a pretty unlikely pair on august th of tonsomi and s ming you went viral for their alleged romantic relationship it began with an anonymous post on an online community forum where netizens shared their speculations about the two of them being in a relationship as alleged proof the netizen attached a picture of mingyu and somi wearing the same laced white shirt and wrote whats up with their clothes however many netizens didnt think much of the rumors and they were quick to share their thoughts one madison wrote even if they were dating do you think theyd make it that obvious after a member from the same group as getting so much hate right now hinting out whats been happening with s joshua he got caught in a dating rumor as well but his situation has escalated way more than mean use at the beginning of august this year joshua was accused of dating a famous model tommy young who previously appeared on the dating show before sunrise people began to suspect joshua my young might be in a relationship after they saw the duo share a lot of of identical clothes after that netizens began to compile a list of possible evidence that would prove joshua and my young are really together one twitter user posted a snippet of s online concert where mion can allegedly be seen in the video one edison wrote im usually skeptical when people throw around dating allegations due to similar outfits but this seems a bit much another netizen commented if they date quietly then the fans would turn a blind eye the idol is thoughtless and so is his girlfriend lol many netizens were disappointed that the alleged couple didnt try harder to hide their relationship the situation slowly got worse with fans demanding pleitas entertainment release and official statement and flooding my youngs instagram with hateful comments and threats on august th news about fans sending protest trucks to the agencys building went viral unfortunately the message on the trucks was nowhere near supportive it actually demanded joshua leave the group the message read a celebrity who tramples on the hard work of their members and the sincerity of their fans has no future although a lot of people were disappointed by the dating allegations the thought that kicking joshua out of the group is not the right solution adding that the protest truck was probably sent by international fans because of how the message was written regardless of the dating rumors there are thousands of fans who support joshua and who have been defending him for malicious comments as of right now cletus hasnt released any official statement the same day mingyu and somis possible relationship caught in edisons interest tongshao a former member of cosmic girls was leaned to actor tony leong this dating rumor was a huge surprise to a lot of netizens because of their year age difference according to the chinese news outlet sheena local media speculated that xiao and tony have been having an extramarital affair and that xiao even had a child with tony despite his marriage to actress karina lao while xiaos management has yet to comment on the rumors tonys representative agency shared there is no need to pay attention to rumors this claim is absurdly fake please become happy and optimistic people a few netizens commented that the claim about xiao having a child has to be fake because shes been very busy with her acting career here in china others called it the most unique dating rumor that theyve heard in a while showing that theyre not taking it seriously at all the news of blackpinks jisoo and ambul hyun being in a relationship rocked the kpop world recently as well their relationship was revealed on august rd when dispatch reported that jisoo and bolhan are dating adding pictures of the two taken at the location of jisoos home very shortly after dispatchs report both of their agencies yg and fn entertainment confirmed the speculations the statement said theyre getting to know each other with positive feelings we would be thankful if you look upon them with warmth although the couple was met with a lot of support which isnt very common in the kpop world there were still a few fans who expressed their disappointment one edison wrote i wonder if jisoo chose ambo hyun because she has never had a boyfriend before because jisoo was such a huge name in pop culture both media and fans began digging into bullhyuns past they began criticizing him for some of the youtube channels that he subscribed to and the way that he behaved during behind the scenes videos from filming and generally being incredibly hateful towards the actor thank hopefully the number of fans who are supportive of jisoo is much bigger so hopefully the couple will be able to endure the pressure of their celebrity status and displeased fans before jisoo and bohans relationship was confirmed there were rumors about lisa dating french ceo frederick arnold the son of the worlds wealthiest man and while the rumors continue to this day since the beginning of people have been speculating that these two could be more than just friends lisa and frederick are known to be very close friends as the ceo was once spotted out one of the groups shows various korean media outlets reported on the speculations after lisa and frederick were spotted together in paris while a lot of netizens saw it as hanging out with a group of friends it still made the headlines and sparked a heated debate the speculation started again after lisa shared a few pictures where she seems to be enjoying her vacation in greece eagleeyed netizens noticed that fredericks sisterinlaw posted a few pictures very similar to lisas netizens agreed that lisa was possibly on a vacation with the arnold family before her upcoming shows and schedule in addition to that on august the picture of lisa and frederick hanging out in a private airport lounge created a lot of buzz online it speculated that after blackpink wrapped up their shows in new jersey lisa and frederick flew to los angeles in a private plane the picture earned various reactions from netizens while most of them were positive a few wondered how its going to affect the groups potential contract renewal some even went as far as claiming that this was the end of lisas career in the entertainment industry and she will soon get married so far yg entertainment hasnt commented on the dating rumors yet and many fans are left wondering if the pictures are just a coincidence or not at the end of july it was txts bongu and le seraphims taiwans turn to get caught up in dating speculations and edison tweeted a picture of bongyu hanging out in the group storm while theres nothing out of the ordinary about the picture at first glance the netizen noticed an unusual object on top of the groups fridge which turned out to be a small standee of taiwan from when she was still promoting with eyes one then edison tweeted why is their taiwan merch in the txt dorm the tweet prompted other similar posts to appear on korean online communities with netizens serving the internet to find even more proof another part of the socalled evidence that bomb gu and taiwan are dating was a shot of taiwan reacting to txts performance of good boys gone bad at last years melon music awards during the part where bongyu raised up a lighter and an open flame appeared on the stage taiwan appeared to be concerned generally many netizens thought that these were just coincidences rather than proof that bongyu and taiwan are in a relationship as for why there was a taiwan standy on their fridge and that is uncommented that txt actually lived with their managers so it could easily belong to someone else it seems like netizens like txt and le seraphim together because at the beginning of it was rumored that yonjun and eunjin were in a relationship but nothing came out of it even though mama moose huasa keeps her private life protected rumors about her having a boyfriend began to spread at the end of june of this year korean news outlet sports soul was the first one to report these speculations stating that huasa is in a relationship with an entrepreneur who was years her senior this man also reportedly used to work in the music industry allegedly the two have been in a relationship for the past five years and it was actually huasa who decided to pursue her boyfriend an anonymous insider said because wasa is years younger than a and shes a famous artist whos well known to the public he wasnt able to easily accept her romantic advances the anonymous insider added that mr a is doing a good job being hwasas mentor as he often gives her advice when huasa has to face a big decision the speculations were neither confirmed nor denied p nation did release a statement following the speculations but all they said was that it was difficult to confirm the rumors as theyre about wasas personal life and they asked for her fans sincere understanding and lastly highlights dont goon decided to announce his relationship with the bang as he not only revealed that hes been in a relationship for the past few years but he also announced that he would be getting married later in september this year through a handwritten letter dongun shared a few details about his relationship he announced that because his girlfriend isnt in the entertainment industry their wedding is going to be a small ceremony meant for their family and their closest friends full moons agency around us entertainment released a statement reminding the moons fans that since his soontobe wife isnt a celebrity they wont be sharing any details such as the wedding date or the location this announcement was definitely a huge surprise to kpop fans but we wish nothing but the best to the future newlyweds let us know what you think about these couples in the comments down below thank you for watching bye guys
kFSYjEAnn9w,my kpop opinions that will get you heated but they must be said,hey everyone i have some opinions and were going to discuss them im tired im chatty and randy so disclaimer read if you decide to be pissy in the comments and lets get started ruin is what yall want yunen to be everyone has been so obsessed with yunen being the idol that will squash all these standards and expectations in the industry and get disappointed because shes adhering to them instead but like reals right there music she calls out behavior and literally the best part no filter she constantly shows her real beautiful skin no smoothing no whitewashing just so if youre only standing yen because youre expecting her to change the industry while shes still a semi rookie then just go stand rjan instead i also did mention in this video about what i think about all of these expectations and hate against l seraphim in general so you can check that out if youre interested l seraphims life performances especially their coella performance was disappointing you can blame hype or source music but these companies dont have to go forest a mic into their face for them to practice or build skills i know everyones like its hard to sing and dance at the same time yeah i know and thats why not everyone does it and thats why a selected few or picked to do it because theyre supposed to be able to do that thats like saying dont blame the accountant math is really hard well yeah but thats like what theyre getting paid for jesu is useful for black pink and i know a lot of people like to call jesu a doesen especially because she seemed to have recently regressed a bit and vocals and danceability but i honestly feel like people have either forgotten or undermined how useful jiu was for sustaining blackpinks popularity around the kis love era during that point literally all of the blackpink members were embroiled in problematic behavior from lazy scandals to xenophobia and honestly jiu was singlehandedly keeping the fandom afloat she might not be the best vocalist or dancer but thats the case for a lot of idols in their groups she does however have talent and with practice i truly think she can be good but aside from that her importance comes from literally being the personality of black pink i do not think you guys realize how imperative her presence was for keeping black beings fandom alive there there was a reason she became the favorite member for non fans some fans make their achievements seem undeserved are a huge group their records and success speak volumes but their fans make all of that very hard to believe or rely on when they do like this why are we buying in bulk and then throwing it away like maybe donate maybe just be normal when there is such a huge discrepancy between physical sales and streams it makes someone even as successful in legendary is feel shammy when they arent so theyre crazy talented and successful and fans should give them that credit and stop acting like this k poppies whose fave groups have either clearly gotten heavy inspiration from btss work chapter one or two or literally follow their career trajectory learning from them and walking through their paved way should have no right to ever insult bts you would rarely see this happen in any other industry see senor artists especially those that heavily influen newer artists are always respected and regarded highly especially by fans of the junior artists but in kpop no matter how clear the inspiration is yall fail to see it and acknowledge how important bts are and this also extends far beyond kies and to korean media as well how do you guys still not see how important bts have been to you guys like but lets be real if your fav artists are copying bts you who cannot be hating on bts theyre like your dads dad thats your grandpa show some damn respect the double standards of new jeanss fans is actually crazy and weve seen it unfold in k a few days ago news came out that a member of iset juan he would sit out a performance because she was feeling ill and the comments were overwhelmingly horrible with people saying it was media play or just saying shes not fit to be an idol if shes sick so easily very few people were actually nice and wish in her well and then a few days later nenes hyen was seen in crutches and the comments were all wishing her well which is great and how its supposed to be but none of this extended towards eyelet because minhen and eugene sts attacked them before iet had a chance to even build a fan base even people who rightfully call it out were bashed makes you think no speaking of double standards seo song exposes another double standard among kup fans remember when everyone and their mom decided to boycott hybe and hyp artists focusing heavily on boycotting bts especially rms upcoming release which is fine if thats what you guys truly wanted to do but it does seem like that was not the real issue because how come all of you were saying things like rm would understand that were standing for humanity by not listening to his music while simultaneously using ziko song who is by the way another hype artist for every one of your tik toks not to mention iit song magnetic which is also under hype i kid you not when im scrolling my for you page on my kpop tik tok account this is exactly what it sounds music like forget the fact that zika was just problematic on his own i mean his mom literally outed him out for being violent he maybe connect to the burning sun scandal question mark and he is under hyp which we were supposed to be boycotting but no no no its never about really boycotting it only applies to bts silly me i forgot for everyone whos like jys about to come home now its over for minhen no despite all of the jokes armies make talking about his rebellion and couldnt care less attitude towards its companys rules he is still just a singer a musician who for all its worth does not need to involve himself on a matter that does not concern him in any way it doesnt even concern his company its his company parent company the way armies are so ready to involve him like he hasnt worked hard enough and doesnt deserve to just come back and relax and not be slithered into some stupid fight hes a grown man and acts like it which cannot be said about most of the people involved in the hy versus ador fight and please for gods sake if i see any of rats comments about the court case in any of his lives i will lose it he was in the literal military working his ass off for like months all i want is for him to come home and yell at his computer screen for like hours a day playing some dumbass video game i cant recognize he is not an executive hes not hypes hr rep or legal team or pr team or their board of directors he is a singer dont you dare make him waste his vocal abilities on petty that doesnt concern him leave the king alone shoo speaking of this issue yall need to block kuu and panoa and other accounts like them the amount of misinformation being spread for just clicks is actually horrendous twisting btss words bringing back issues that were debunked and solved and making them sound like new problems just to fuel the hate wagon against them like here i was trying to explain to yall that its not eyelet versus new jeans its hyp versus mehan but you guys are a step ahead of me trying to involve bts in an issue that doesnt involve them they seriously need to pull a wong and su their ass because none of you illiterate k poppies bother to actually read the content and go off with the sensational headline which is about as accurate as a dave disy video let me know if you want me to make a whole video on this because clearly i have a lot to say just the double standards against bts with these k poppies is just whatever ill save it for my next video so stay tuned and lastly but very very crucially genocide is not a reason to hold a contest to see which idol is better than another considering yall are the same people that think idols quote didnt know the nword was offensive or that braids or cultural appropriation or what aa stands for you sure are bold as hell for saying that them posting a bang se painting is them showing their support for palestine seriously how low of you to see an active genocide happening and your first instinct is to use it to make your favorite idols seem like saints and of course blink spreading lies and using this issue for fan wars posting the same totally fabricated post made by a fan saying lisa donated to palestinian children did she because not a single source was found for this all that was found is that bulgari a brand that appointed lisa held this campaign and apparently ros singing a coldplay song from that mentions jerusalem means shes supporting palestine like youre really not escaping the illiterate accusations or your geography final and this i literally have no words in reality theyve not really been doing anything and this goes for a lot of these kpop fandoms in reality displaying a painting is doing nothing and as an army this goes for armies too these idols especially third generation idols who have a significant following they have low of money and could do a lot more with it than like a post or have a model follow them they could have donated privately great wonderful why again are we creating these inhumane collages comparing whos the better savior this is objectively disgusting in fact a lot of your favorite idols are still working with very questionable companies so since these idols love to flex their money and designer to us all the time why dont they flex harder and donate that is all for this video again these are my opinions with come on i might be biased because you know im me but like it or not a lot of what i said really needs to drill into a lot of peoples heads and you can help do that by liking this video and even commenting to boost it so it reaches more people maybe share it with your ignorant kpop motes and subscribe for more videos like this so i know you enjoy them thank you for sticking around till the end and ill see you soon in my next one
YYlDRjqrIA8,unpopular kpop opinions cuz ador filed an injunction against newjeans,one ador had filed an injunction to block new genes from signing ad contracts outside of their exclusive agreement after that manager was caught going behind adors back to contact advertisers it gave hve all the evidence they needed to flex their legal muscle and maintain control over the groups activities especially after the december rd lawsuit about the exclusive contract validity this isnt just about keeping new genes in check its about sending a message to anyone thinking of stepping out of line whether its the members their team or third party advertisers at this point ive lost count of many lawsuits and junctions we had new jeans running around like theyre untouchable is cute but the legal mess they snowballing into practically rights itself and once they lose the contract validity case because spoiler alert they will things are going to get even uglier who knows maybe theyll finally come to their senses maybe the court handing them illegal slap is exactly what they need call it a lesson in reality because clearly common sense isnt on the menu you cant scream im out while still clinging to all the perks like the dorm visa staff and income also many still question why ad door is still open to rehash things with the girls when theyre this untrustworthy but hyve isnt playing defense here theyre out for blood if you think theyre letting new jeans out of their clutches without a fight youre delusional this isnt about trusting new jeans its about making sure mama manhan doesnt pull off the stunt of the century and walts away with their golden goose hive isnt protecting the girls theyre safeguarding their reputation their investors and their money letting new jeans red debut under minhen thats like handing her a blank check with a slap on the wrist not happening and hyde knows well that if they let this slide their entire operation takes a hit who who the heck would trust them with a new group after that investors would be bailing faster than a sinking ship and no ones lining up to buy stock in a company that cant even keep their teenage idols in line its not just about losing new genes its about hbes credibility going up in flames so whats the plan drag manhan through the legal mud until shes so buried in lawsuits that no one in the industry will touch her with a ft pull damage her credibility exhaust her resources and make sure any future business proposal she dares to present is dead on arrival hives not just trying to win theyre making an example out of her this isnt a about business anymore its a warning shot to anyone who thinks they can outmaneuver them who youtuber soang has been sentenced to years suspended imprisonment years probation and ordered to pay million for defamation against one young and thats just the appetizer kong daniel already sued her for million one and btsv espa and suo are lining up to finish what they started gs cooked so jang finally getting her dues is the karma buffet weve all been waiting for she spent years turning out trash fires disguised as videos loaded with spliced audio out of context clips blatant lies and straight up body shaming it wasnt even subtle she didnt critique their music or skills she fabricated dating rumors bullying scandals and whatever else would get clicks from a drama hungry audience and for what a quick buck it was reported that she earned over million one from ad revenue and memberships profiting off of her victims reputations and mental health but guess what shell have to pay double that the judges werent hard on her they were fair lets not underestimate the damage she caused idols already live under a microscope one false narrative ative can snowball into years of harassment malicious comments and irreversible damage to their careers and mental wellbeing this wasnt gossip it was targeted defamation designed to ruin lives all while miss soang lined her pockets now shes just facing the consequences shes the perfect example of how parasitic content creators can be when they prioritize clout and cash over basic decency its poetic justice that the idols she exploited are the ones taking her down three to o finally broke his silence addressing his scandal and returned to the industry this is the first time he speaks up since leaving big bang and announcing his retirement back in in a recent interview he acknowledged how its been after his marijuana scandal yes marijuana not some violent crime not corruption not abuse marijuana and yet here we are in and people are still dragging him like he robbed walmart or something while his costars with far worse skeletons in their closets are skating by with barely a slap on the wrist to o opened up about the role he played in squid game his character thanos is a rapper whose life spirals into chaos because of substance use and bad financial decisions the parallels to tps own life are glaringly obvious and he admitted that this made the role both deeply personal and incredibly challenging hes essentially reliving his past demons on screen which takes guts honestly but instead of acknowledging the emotional weight of that people are out here clowning his acting like they missed the entire point the criticism of his acting is hypocrite people are saying its exaggerated over thetop and cringey well duh thats the freaking point his portrayal of thanos wasnt meant to be some nuanced oscar bait performance it was a caricature a refle ction of those tryhard wannabe hiphop heads weve all seen in the scene you know the type loud obnoxious drowning in their own delusions of grandeur t o p nail bat vibe if you didnt pick up on that maybe the problem isnt his acting its your lack of media literacy not every performance is meant to be subtle and restrained sometimes its meant to make you uncomfortable and t o did just that but we all know how cancel culture works like what else you want from him he went on hiatus isolated himself and used music as therapy to piece himself back together hes been open about how hard the past few years have been for him mentally yet instead of acknowledging his growth or even just letting him exist people are still hung up on a scandal thats nearly a decade old while other squid game actors with even dirtier laundry are getting a free pass wheres the outrage for them why is top the only one being crucified in the court of public opinion or i cant with pity standing its the cringiest most performative behaviors ever youre telling me you stand an idol because you feel bad for them sweetheart thats not standing thats emotional charity work and spoiler alert your fave isnt sending you a thank you card for your pity party these pity stand stayed doing the most in the worst way possible theyll hop into every single comment section like omg why does everyone hate xyz theyre so mistreated meanwhile theyre not boosting streams not hyping performances not praising their actual skills just drumming up sob stories and treating their fave like a lost puppy babe this isnt a charity auction if your version of support is reminding the world how tragically underappreciated your bias is then news flash your part of the problem then theres those who bias the least popular member just because its trendy to play savior oh so you picked your fave based on pity points instead of actually vibing with their personality or skills bold of you to assume theyd be flattered by your condescension imagine someone saying youre my favorite because everyone else hates you yeah real heartwarming they dont want your pity they want your respect but clearly thats too much to ask from the moral high ground brigade pity standing isnt support its selfserving validation you dont care about that idol as a person you care about looking like the savior in the fandom youre out here treating them like a charity case while simultaneously screaming look at me im such a good person for loving the under dog its truly tragic five tams agency bpm entertainment released a statement about his activities with shiny honestly why is this even a thing are some fans seriously that dense were talking about sm here the kings of messy scheduling and scapegoating their own idols the second taming missed the sm town concert the rumor mail fired up again accusing bpm of holding him back but hey bpm let vivs join g friends reunion with no drama so why would they block tamin from shiny it doesnt add up and yall really think tamin has no say in this come on he the shiny members have been screaming for years that theyll never abandon the group if hes not showing up its probably because of solo commitments or sm didnt give bpm a heads up early enough to work taming schedule this is sm were talking about they love throwing their idols under the bus wendy xo anybody sm stands should already know this playbook by heart and lets not act like its the end of the world if taming misses a few shiny appearances the groups been around for years taming left sm to prioritize his solo career which means shiny isnt going to be front and center for him all the time anymore thats fine the members are allowed to do their own thing without fans losing their minds every minutes let them breathe its not a betrayal if they occasionally put there individual goals first six lets review w us comeback i know you know w us dropped a special album where they rerecorded many of their past hits i really enjoy albums like this hearing new versions of these songs highlights just how much the members have grown and evolved over the years the title track is a song they performed months ago on mnets road to kingdom titled i know you know and im completely in love with it its a perfect blend of maturity and elegance while still maintaining an upbeat energy the vocal effects in the chorus are genius theyve got this slick retro vibe that feels like its pulling from the best parts of funk and throwing it a with modern kpop polish the way their voices hit the high almost distorted register wow the production has a lot going on its layered its textured and its unapologetically dynamic the funky bursts the groovy precor the little breakdowns they all feel intentional and for the mv its more of a performance video in one location but who cares when the performance is this good the choreography is one of their best its all about storytelling the props the way they move the way the backup dancers weave in and out the sharp cuts and fluid transitions its also meticulously crafted seven lets talk about bb girls comeback love brave girls story is seriously one in a million this second gen group was so close to disbanding when their song roll and randomly went viral in korea years later in it completely brought their dead career back to life after that they had a couple of really successful comebacks with chat baram and thank you in they joined mnets queendom season which usually leads to groups dropping comebacks right after the show ends but brave girls decided to do things differently and went on a long tour instead then in february they left their company brave entertainment and signed with warner music korea because of this they had to rebrand as bb girls which honestly made me a bit nervous brave brothers had been the main producer for all their music so i wasnt sure how their sound would turn out without him their first comeback under warner music one more time ended up being a solid retro track nothing mindblowing but it showed they could still make solid music then member yu jang decided to leave the group after that the remaining three switched companies again and signed with universal music korea at the end of last year now after a year and a half their finally back is a trio with love to its produced by swun the duo behind some really iconic tracks for groups like cara and infinite so naturally expectations were high especially with bb girls strong vocal line but the song sits in this weird moody midtempo limbo thats been beaten to death lately i blame manhan you know the vibe cool enough to avoid being called bad but not nearly bold enough to stand out sweeten signature since make a cameo but theyre watered down like they forgot to turn the volume up on the drama the melody is fine i guess but theres no build no payoff and the short run time doesnt help after everything this group has been through the rebrand the hiatus the industry chaos this should have been their big unapologetic comeback moment instead love two sticks them in a box labeled vibes only and calls it a day
kjNR4YBdMtQ,kpop idols who ruined another idols career,when kpop scandals hit the impact often spreads beyond the idols involved affecting those around them and sometimes even destroying other idols careers entirely one of kpops most surprising scandals is when one group member decided to suddenly throw the other under the bus seemingly with no reason secrets hana caused quite a stir when she one day suddenly revealed intimate facts about her fellow group member sun while guest starring on a variety show hana decided to share how sun acts when she drinks something which caused great consequences for the latters reputation at the time time she described sun as someone who starts to complain and whine about the whole world when she drinks and the comment quickly became a topic of conversation among fans as it seemed to reveal a personal side of sunu that hadnt been seen before sun wasnt happy with how she was portrayed as she quickly took to social media to defend herself against hanas words she explained that they had only drunk together a few times and during one of those times she had confided in hana about her frustrations with the dy image she had gained on variety shows like invincible youth sun attempted to clarify that she wasnt unhappy with everything but just the image she was stuck with on tv she also made it clear that she felt quite a bit of resentment toward hana who had seemingly made her seem like she had a negative outlook on life in addition sun mentioned that there were parts of the situation that fans werent aware of hinting that the full story wasnt out in the open however she emphasized that her problem wasnt with hana directly but instead with how she was portrayed publicly after her words had been aired while the situation didnt seem like a major scandal at first it was the fact that the two had apparently had a a huge fight that had fans speculating about more drama happening behind the scenes after all its rare for idols to bring such internal group matters to the public eye unfortunately for sun the incident did have lasting effects on her career as hanas comments had put her in an uncomfortable position and many believe it impacted how she was viewed in the industry suns attempt to defend herself through social media and fan fors didnt seem to fix the damage that had been done and the fallout from the situation continued to cast a dark shadow over her career big hits original girl group glam faced some slightly different issues as one member scandal seemed to put the company off girl groups for almost a decade the group originally debuted in with five members but quickly ran into trouble when one member left not long after their debut officially it was said to be due to personal reasons but rumors circulated that she was asked to leave because she was allegedly a sasang fan of super juniors leok however these rumors were never confirmed and the exact reason for her departure remains unknown to this day from then on the group continued as four members but in glam found themselves at the center of a huge scandal that would eventually end their career dahi one of the groups members was arrested and accused of blackmailing and extorting popular actor lee buong hun dahi had allegedly threatened to release a compromising video of the actor along with another woman unless he paid them a large sum of money nison were shocked when dahi was found guilty of these charges and even sentenced to jail time to nobodys surprised the scandal destroyed glams reputation and in big hit entertainment decided decided to disband the group stating that their contracts had ended unfortunately the whole thing not only ended glams career but also crushed the dreams of the remaining members as they never got a chance to shine fully in the industry after dahs conviction following this incident big hit entertainment avoided debu in girl groups for several years and many fans believed that it was dahs actions that had turned big hit away from female idols as for dahi despite the scandal she has moved on with her life as she now works as a model and an afria tv model reportedly earning quite a large sum of money every month even though shes no longer involved in the kpop world her story continues to be one of the most infamous in the industry another notorious scandal in kpop involved tiara hong who left the group in and singlehandedly ruined all the momentum and popularity that tiara had built until then at the time won claimed that she had been mistreated by her fellow members especially gian and unjung who allegedly traumatized her by shunning and ignoring her the accusations quickly gained traction with hongs twin sister hio yang also forward to support the claims afterward fans and nens alike found old videos where huong appeared to be mistreated by the other members which had the public completely turn on the rest of the group convinced that they were the perpetrators gian and unjung were especially singled out as the cruestv of the group and the media frenzy that followed was intense some even claimed that the mistreatment had been so obvious that fans wondered how it had gone unnoticed for so long however despite the piling rumors and hongs allegations the truth behind the situation turned out to be a lot more complicated ated than anyone had expected as the scandal spiraled trs former manager came forward in and said that the claims of mistreatment had been nothing but a lie the manager shockingly revealed that in reality the other members were the ones who had suffered from hongs behavior and her allegations only added to the damage she had caused them unfortunately by the time the truth came out it was too late to save tiaras career as public opinion had turned against them and their reputation was forever tarnished unable to recover from the controversy tiara concluded their activities a few months later with the group struggling to continue in the spotlight mistreatment scandals in the industry have only multiplied over the years as former april member hyunju also stepped forward to reveal that she had been tormented by her groupmates for several years hyunju decided to take to instagram in april of to describe the suffering that she faced during her time in the group something which had been ongoing since when she was just years old according to hu the mistreatment lasted for several years until she left the group in initially it was her younger brother who stepped forward to reveal what had happened to hju during her time in april which led her to reveal the details of exactly what she had endured her instagram post made things clear saying during those years i was forced to suffer because of violent actions and behavior ridicule swearing and attacks on my character according to her their agency dsp media were fully aware of what had been going on during her time in the group but had simply chosen to do nothing to stop it which only made her feel more isolated and unsupported hju even revealed that the situ situation became so unbearable that she attempted to take her own life in as she could feel herself falling into a darkness she couldnt escape what made things even worse was that even after her attempt her agency and group members showed no concern or remorse for her suffering which only deepened her trauma in response to these accusations dsp media released a statement denying hus claims calling her post a onesided distorted assertion that is far from the objective truth several members of april also spoke out denying the accusations aprils yenna st forward to say i always felt that one member was constantly pushing us away when something happened to all of us she thought of herself as the only victim chwan also denied the accusations while also dismissing rumors that she had been dating their manager at the time calling it complete nonsense however despite the denials yanju stood strongly by her claims and because of this dsp media decided to file lawsuits against her and her brother as they claimed defamation this led to all of hus professional activities being halted making it nearly impossible for her to continue her career unfortunately nothing has seemed to work out for her longterm ever since the lawsuits but despite the trauma and struggles yanju has vowed not to give up saying from now on i will no longer stand by without taking action to protect myself my family and my acquaintances but perhaps one of kpops biggest scandals happened when huna and dawn made their relationship public in becoming one of the few public idol couples something which sent ripples throughout the industry while many fans praised huna for being so open and admired her confidence in living her truth the fallout for dawns group pentagon was extremely severe pentagon was still a rookie group at the time with only two years under their belt and they were slowly building their fan base however the dating scandal combined with a series of other rumors sparked a downfall that many fans believe was mostly the cause for the groups downfall the drama kicked off in august as numerous dating rumors involving the pentagon members exploded in a matter of a few days hooie for example was caught in a dating scandal with suen of idol on august nd and then rumor c about pentagons uto dating yun from clc not long after however the most shocking news was huna and dons confirmed relationship despite cube entertainment initially denying the speculations about them being a couple huna took to social media to set the record straight she wanted to be honest with her fans and in her words just wanted to be truthful while hunas fans were quick to support her decision the consequences for dawn and the pentagon were brutal fans of pentagon especially those who were new to the group were less forgiving and pentagon wasnt prepared for the storm that followed fans went as far as returning tickets to the fan club event for their new official fandom and their promotions were severely impacted as fans boycotted the group even triple h the project group that included huna dawn and huie saw their events being cancelled and eventually the group disbanded due to the backlash at the time many saw hunas decision as selfish given that pentagon was still trying to establish themselves in the industry while huna was already a veteran in kpop with over years of experience and a solid fan base of her own dawn and pentagon were still finding their place the negative reactions were immediate and while triple h disbanded pentagon was left to pick up the pieces many fans left the fandom all together feeling betrayed by the dating news and for a rookie group losing such a significant part of their fan base was a huge blow one that took them years to recover from looking back many people still wonder what could have been for pentagon had the scandals not occurred despite everything the group has continued to release music and gain fans over the years but the scandal marked a turning point for them and some still view it as the moment when their career path changed forever
hhvlj4VMPxc,why every kpop fan boycotts rain right now,rain has been described as a kid wanting a pet but grows bored of it pretty fast in relation to how he has treated the groups hes managed but what exactly was wrong with rains management of these groups that made kpop fans hate him so much first lets talk about the groups in question m black was undoubtedly one of the groups with the most potential in the industry dubbed as the next dbang shingi they debuted in and got tons of attention initially as they were produced by kop legend rain and managed by jtune camp which was a subsidiary of the company rain founded jtune entertainment in these guys burst onto the scene with a bang stealing the show at reigns legend of reism concert and making a name for themselves right off the bat then in their fame shot through the roof as they nabbed their first victory on m countdown with the track y and even scooped up the title of best rookie group at this point they were pretty popular due to their association with rain eun was especially wellliked amongst the public due to his variety show appearances they were also promoted heavily so even if nison wanted to ignore them it was impossible to do so jumping into m black took a leap to japan and served up the hit mona lisa followed by other earworms like this is war and scribble then things were shaken up in the lineup that happened in when e jun and thunder waved goodbye reshaping m black as a trio this is when their popularity started to drop skipping to gio meu and zho dropped mirror before taking a break from kpop right around that time jun camp vanished too sparking speculation among fans whether m black had wrapped up or if a comeback was in the cards you might have guessed one was the case but why does rain specifically get blamed for this well rain was right there in the mix not just creating the group but also training and guiding them through their initial releases but the year after their debut a merger went down between jtune entertainment and jyp entertainment making jtune camp stand on its own as an independent corporate body without a solid company backing them the guys had their hands full with various gigs which made it difficult for them to focus on their singing path m blacks promotions happened in bur with members often prioritizing their solo endeavors over the group group and it didnt help the groups popularity in the slightest all this change happened so rain could give his singing and acting more attention before he suited up for military service in after he was finished with military service people thought rain would make a comeback to the company but surprise he inked a deal with a branch of cube entertainment which some fans saw as him sort of leaving behind ml and girl group x the decline of jtune camp led to x waving goodby and it was also the reason why eune and thunder took their leave from m black come jtune camp completely dissolved out of nowhere turns out that jtune camp had terminated contracts with their singers and staff a few months before managers and staff also stepped away from their roles resulting in jtune being officially out of action but the fact that the company closed suddenly wasnt the only time that ml was let down by them gio explained that after june and thunder left ml had been assured two mini albums in a fan meeting however they ended up with just one mini album and you guessed it no fan meeting gio even offered to foot the bill for the fan meeting but jun camp pulled the plug due to to their own financial troubles they also had quietly removed eml from their online profiles keeping both the members and fans in the dark about it in a surprising turn the trophy from embls first music show win was discarded by jtune camp gio also spoke out about the things that he experienced when he was still a part of the group he wrote a letter to fans in january of revealing that due to the agencys financial issues and questionable management he had to part ways with two members initially unaware he blamed others for coping over time he suho and muu started connecting the dots on the labels unethical behavior because of everything that had gone on gio started coping with his troubles by drinking excessively he continued by sharing that the public opinion was tough when the group released mirror and the media kept putting out harsh articles this is when his confidence started taking a hit and he felt the need to apologized to his fans looking back he realized that he had been living a life of fierce competition and that had left him emotionally drained he said i was afraid i would lose my fans manager stylist hair and makeup artists and friends in the past i really felt like i was living through separation every day his statement only angered fans who were already blaming rain for abandoning the groups after he signed with cube fans also said that rain had probably invested his all into a group but once they showed to not be doing as well as he expected he dumped them to focus on his own career when it comes to madtown a few argued that they were just a casualty of everything that had happened so far madtown werent nearly as successful as m black but they had potential they were still very talented and deserved to have a fair shot out of career but when jtune camp dissolved out of nowhere madtown was sold to gni entertainment for million w then the ceo of gni group faced a fraud arrest in february which led to the arrest of madtowns agency ceo on account of the same charges the company folded causing all the staff including madtowns manager to leave despite being kicked out of their dorm the group powered on funding their activities themselves in the end all seven members jointly took legal action to scrap their contracts and officially dissolve them in the soul central district court however blaming rain for what happened to madtown has been argued to be kind of a stretch rain had already signed with cube entertainment a year before madtown even debuted so to blame him for the groups success or lack thereof is not really fair yes the company had problems that may have been caused by rains mismanagement of it but matt toown debuted after rain already cut ties with the company and moved on to another one but then theres the case of cipher cipher burst onto the scene with i like you in march under rain company which was an agency selfestablished by rain the group followed up with three mini albums by rain went all in for ciphers debut showcase handling the social side of things his wife actress gim pei even popped up in ciphers debut music video showing her full support at the debut showcase rain came out swinging saying that hed staked his life on ciphers creation but after the release of their mini album the code they kind of went mia which really worried their fans two members even participated in boy planet and made it all the way to the final which made fans think that the group would be more active especially now since they got clout from the show but that never ended up happening they showed show up on fan apps like bubble hyped and ready for a comeback that never happened on the social media front its been quiet just a handful of instagram posts one live session and a solitary tik tok after boy planet happened now if the lack of comeback wasnt enough fans are raising their pitchforks about cancelled gigs the only schedule cipher had the kpop allstar music festival got canceled out of the blue sparking concerns there were also complaints about the ticket prices with people comparing them to joyland festival whose prices were much more affordable rumor has it that there were a lot of tickets sold by the time the festival was cancelled which goes against the company story that there wasnt much buzz around it but because ciphers one and only gig got cancelled you think that rain company would scramble for another right well the same day the kpop allstar music festival got cancelled kcon la posted their lineup but this caused even more backlash as rain was on the list of the artists but not the group that he managed fans are wondering if the companys more invested in rains own career than cipher in the end four members ended up leaving and well there was nothing left of the group but fans wouldnt have let ciphers unfair disbandment slip so easily so to show just how dissatisfied they were with the management of the group they joined hands with other fandoms and planned a black ocean during rains performance at kcon la so when rain started his performance lots of people switched off their light sticks and the crowd didnt cheer or sing along either some of them even booing him it appears that some people kept light sticks up just because they were unaware of who rain was or that there was even a boycott happening in the first place even nison supported the black ocean expressing saying that these were only the consequences of his actions there were multiple articles about the boycott getting the attention from international fans as well lets just say rain is not in the good graces of the public unlike m black or madtown fans had no doubt that rain was to blame for the way things ended with cipher after all he even called himself their manager it didnt make it any better that the members kept requesting a comeback but they were kept in the basement as rain kept focusing on his activities rather than those of the group he manages unfortunately the group came to an end and the members that after are going their separate ways so we only can wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors thank you for watching and see you in the next video bye
4u2WQgZ4oUY,the real reason why bts never had a real dating scandal,despite being a group for nearly years bts havent had any real dating news throughout their careers being the most sought out group by the media in korea and worldwide youd think that at least one of the members would have their relationship exposed so whats the real reason they havent had any dating scandals and why is it so weird no matter how much of a controversial topic it is in south korea dating rumors are still a part of an idols career idols from big groups like girls generation big bang exo red velvet twice and black pink have all had their fair share of dating rumors and even confirmed relationship and marriage news bts on the other hand havent had a single one ever since their debut in yup they havent had one serious dating rumor in the entirety of their careers and its been nearly years this though seems impossible in hindsight bts are unarguably the biggest kpop group in the world everyones eyes are on them all the time so theres not a chance that they could be hiding anything even if they wanted to with all the media the obsessive stalker fans that follow their every move and dispatch youd think that there would be at least one chance that theyd slip up but there wasnt theres always the possibility that theyre too busy to do so but lets be real from a group of seven boys you wanna tell me that none of them are dating many fans keep saying that theyre too busy which is true but this is almost unreal its more than possible that they have dated before and maybe are dating right now but are just keeping it lowkey and staying quiet about it but why they are seven attractive rich and famous men so to everyone else thats not delusional its a given that they must be dating someone bighit also dont have any restrictions when it comes to their idols dating in their contracts so technically theres nothing thats stopping them from doing so well except for some very crazy fans just like with every other idol and company big hit marketed the bts members as always being available to fans and fans only they pushed the narrative that the boys are single and only dedicated to the fans and this will backfire at them once their relationships become public because fans are so used to seeing the members available and expressing their love to their fandom seeing dating rumors of their favorite idol would be a slap in the face they see the idols partner as competition and once they get confirmation that there is someone whos getting in the way of their delusions of ever dating the idol theyll go crazy the shippers are also a big problem because theyre convinced that the members are dating each other and anyone else getting in the way of their ship will be perceived as evil all of what im talking about right now was proven right when jungkook hyung and even namdoon were involved in some relationship rumors on september th of a cctv screenshot was released on an online community in the screenshot you can see a guy who looks suspiciously like jungkook hugging a girl from behind the girl was suspected to be popular tattoo artist imidu the picture looked quite intimate so it was no surprise that the two were suspected to be dating and that the news spread around then to make things worse another picture of jungkook and miju from a different day got released where they can be seen having drinks together but as always fans try to deflect from the situation first people claim that the mail in the picture was actually rapper swan not jungkook but the rapper denied the rumors by himself on his instagram then they claimed that miju had been married for years and even ended up messaging the tattoo parlor she works at to confirm this i know sounds crazy right they found out that while miju wasnt really married she was in a relationship with someone that wasnt dunk the rumors had spiraled at that point with some people claiming that the two had tattooed each others initials and were getting pretty serious miju took the time to deny the rumors herself and big hit came out and said that the two were just friends and were hanging out but even though the situation was resolved quickly miju ended up getting harassed and threatened by some toxic jungkook fans in fact the tattoo shop manager themselves was being hounded by the fans and had to speak out to make them stop they said just because i said jungkook didnt get his tattoo done here im in danger of getting fired im getting a lot of messages through my personal social media accounts i dont understand why im getting cursed out yes they even threatened the store manager they also added that the shop was reported to the police and that their friends family and acquaintances were all being threatened by these fans i dont think that we should even call them fans as this is straightup saucing behavior the same thing happened once namjoon got involved in some dating rumors of his own usually armies assumed that the btss older members being open about their relationships will be better received by these delusional fans there have also been lots of jokes about namjoon being married and having three kids but when the fandom were actually faced with rumors the reaction was bad really bad on the very last day of youtuber sojung posted a video with the title bts rm table girlfriend reveal to gram evidence for the first time he said in the video the fact that arum has a girlfriend is really famous among fans who have the ability to get information he went on to say the moment when rm was nervous because he forgot that he was wearing a ring on his fourth finger during a broadcast has been known by overseas fans as well they also said that namjoon has been dating his girlfriend ever since and that shes the daughter of someone who was very famous in the art world they came to the conclusion after they found some similar posts on both of their instagrams and once toxic fans caught a whiff of the rumors and had found the instagram account of who they suspected to be namjoons girlfriend they harassed her in the comments for days until big hit and namjoon released statements of their own denying the rumors the company even threatened to sue anyone whod spread false allegations against their artists considering all of this its understandable why bts wouldnt be public with their relationships if fans reacted this strongly to only rumors imagine the reactions if the relationships were actually confirmed but even if bts and bighit are the ones who arent confirming dating rumors why havent dispatch or any other media outlet for that matter released any paparazzi picks of the members on dates or with their significant others i mean dispatch arent the ones to hold back as they have exposed numerous idols ranging from famous ones to new goose so why havent they ever released pictures of any of the bts members out on dates or meeting their partners out well theres a theory about this but remember nothing is confirmed so this shouldnt be taken as a fact theres a rumor on the internet going around that dispatch and hive have some exclusive deals that stops dispatch from ever exposing btss relationships people assume that in exchange for dispatch being quiet the company offered them exclusive access to some behind the scenes things bts are also set to appear on dispatchs year anniversary concert to festa knowing just how booked and busy bts are and how hard they are to book in the first place it was strange when it was announced that bts would actually perform at the concert the deal would be pretty logical from a business viewpoint if it turns out to be real having a working relationship with the biggest group in the world would be worth more to dispatch than any of the clickbaity pieces that they could put out about them on the other hand the chances of this deal actually being a real thing wouldnt make sense at all sure dispatch have never exposed any of the members relationships but they have put out plenty of pieces that were slandering btss name this might be a tactic to hide the two companies having an exclusive deal but thats even less likely the truth might be that dispatch does whatever they want depending on what they get in exchange its simply business but lets talk about the most reasonable explanation to why bts have never had any real dating rumors bts have managed to keep some sense of privacy even after they blew up in the west the members have mastered the technique of not revealing too much information about themselves and still making you feel like you know them their private lives remain private and dispatch has in fact confirmed this dispatch have said that the members are also insanely busy and traveling all the time which makes them harder to follow around even if they are in korea theyre always in each others company which made it boring for dispatch to follow them looking for a scoop in fact the one time jungkook left their dorm and seemed to be headed somewhere dispatch followed behind thinking that theyd finally get some pictures of him going on a date imagine their surprise when jungkook just went to the grocery store and got some banana milk for himself i bet they were pretty disappointed at the outcome of their little outing but whether the lack of dating news on btss part means that theyre simply not seeing anyone dating someone in secret or maybe that hype is just that powerful of an industry to stop the news from ever coming out i guess well never know however when the news actually does come out its important to remember that these are grown men with their own private lives its obvious that they love the fans and have great appreciation for their dedication but this doesnt mean that they cant have a life outside of them both the bts members and their partners deserve great respect and privacy from the media and from the fans themselves its literally the least everyone can do why do you think bts havent had any dating scandals thus far in their career share your thoughts in the comments thank you so much for watching and see you next time bye

Dz5JRVMWmkw,the bizarre legacy of gossip girl,ill keep that in mind so if youre under the age of youve probably heard of the show gossip girl is this show about pretty white people who do things just like every other show youve ever seen and it was really popular during its entire run between and i used to be obsessed with gossip girl i would even go as far as to say that it was majam and from what modern pop culture has to say i wasnt the only one to be obsessed with it the show is kind of iconic and is considered to be one of if not the best teen drama of all time maybe shes born with this its also worth noting that i was the perfect age when it came out i was around or years old somewhere along those lines so i was completely taken away by the hype like i completely fell in love with the thing gossip girl was a phenomenon that completely corrupted the minds of teenagers at the time and i was definitely one of them and just like pretty little liars gossip girl is getting a reboot sequel on hbo max this year so going through the original series sounded fun to me just to look back at what once was now i gotta say that gossip girl is a show that i struggle to completely grasp not in terms of the story the shows not all that complex but rather its sort of impossible status in pop culture the iconography of gossip girl is something that kind of escapes me because all things considered this show should not have worked or at least not the way it did there are so many aspects of this show that are just beyond me its a little weird and i think it makes the whole thing very interesting to dive into so you know lets do that gossip girl is a show that broke all the rules and it was rewarded for it on every front its what people call lightning in a bottle a recipe thats impossible to recreate the circumstances were perfect we were coming out of an era of team television that was great but was also starting to be a little stale and overdone the genre needed a new flair it needed to be reinvented and that is why gossip girl came at the perfect time now back then the idea of a show painting teenagers as sexcrazed maniacs on drugs was sort of becoming a thing because in the same year the uk got to have its own anthem of teen debauchery with skins which also heavily weaponized sex drugs and alcohol to appeal to audiences but the uk was no stranger to raunchy content for teenagers it is for america where everything is so heavily censored all the time that it was kind of controversial suddenly people got to see teenagers doing cocaine and sleeping with prostitutes an overwhelming number of creepy adult women sleeping with underage boys and at times forcing them to a lot of creepy men sleeping with underage girls and if youre one of those people who were shocked about that riverdale scene where a year old betty gives a lap dance on the stage in front of a crowd of grown adults well know that gossip girl did it first and they were very conscious of all of this the original marketing campaign for the show was sort of unusual and provocative for the time the show was priding itself on being scandalous and made the very idea of taboos the major selling point of the first season the posters were highlighted by quotes from the media saying things like every parents nightmare or mindblowingly inappropriate like the show consciously weaponized controversy to turn the curiosity of the audience in their favor and i think that was pretty clever because they werent gonna lose press and audiences for being problematic they were openly bragging about being problematic and thats what got everybody to watch they appealed to this up part of our human brains that just want to see up go down and it worked gossip girl is what i can confidently refer to as an instant classic from the very first few episodes it completely transformed television and it took over the world it even got to have remakes adapted by different cultures with the releases of gossip girl turkey gossip girl china gossip girl acapulco gossip girl thailand and as recently as gossip girl indonesia hell to this day even american tv shows are still miserably trying to recapture the sense of novelty gossip girl had almost years ago god im old years i gotta get my life together so gossip girl is the story of a bunch of rich kids from new york city who like to party do drugs and have sex and overall just do crazy all year long they try to navigate their luxurious lives in the upper east side all under the watchful eye of gossip girl an enigmatic individual on the internet who has permission to uncover their secrets at all costs and make them public everyone seems to be operating on a very specific and sheltered status quo but things suddenly begin to change when serena vanderwoodsen the former id girl of this elite community returns to new york one year after suddenly running away to connecticut under mysterious circumstances and this right there is where i think gossip girl is really clever as a show because on its own the premise is not all that interesting its just a bunch of rich kids being rich but by adding a mystery element to serena the writers do a great job at making you want to know what the hell is going on here who is this girl why did she leave why is everyone so freaked out that shes back and it keeps you engaged long enough for you to become obsessed with all the other stuff going on in the show and theyre really good at carrying that for a while because then the show goes off the rail because yeah there are a number of problems with gossip girl and the show definitely doesnt end as strongly as it starts and if you know me you know that i think the shows downfall tends to start with how the writers handle the characters so in that spirit lets take a look at the main cast of the cws gossip girl and someone better hold my hand now because this gets ugly serena vanderwoodsen shes really boring okay not exactly though in season one serena is actually a fascinating character and i like her quite a lot shes kind of a tortured soul you can tell theres something off about her that explains why shes been through such a change but like i said the show does a really good job at keeping that enigmatic thread going so her character has a mystery element that makes her pretty cool you always get this sense that theres something shes not saying and while that something is not in the forefront of the show it still manages to build a solid sense of engagement throughout you learned that serena used to be a very different person a bit more like blair actually but probably even worse she was all cold and mean she was the quintessential cliche of the rich spoiled party girl and its implied several times throughout the season that she might have been suffering from an alcohol addiction and even after her return you can tell that shes kind of struggling with her newfound inner peace shes trying really hard to be a good person but at times her former mean girl impulses get the better of her and she goes into full blare mode i really like how her past self often comes back to haunt her and she has a difficult time proving to people that she has changed because when she comes back to new york everyone expects the worst from serena like everybody is just waiting for her to mess things up for herself and for everyone else shes held to a very low standard by her peers and her own family and you can tell that it really bothers her that powerful untouchable queen image she has become so famous for is drowning this layer of problematic debauchery everybody sees in her and the show does a really good job at showing you that its not really an easy thing to live with especially when you dont want to be that person anymore and all of that is perfectly anchored in her relationship with dan she falls in love with this outsider guy who doesnt know much about her past and hes kind of the only person who sees her for who she is now but the closer she gets to him the closer he gets to her world and he ends up inevitably being exposed to everything she used to be dan is suddenly forced to see the serena everyone else sees the shame the mean excessive party girl who did drugs and slept with her best friends boyfriend before running away and it creates a really dramatic imbalance that carries the early episodes really well at first the show makes you believe serena ran away from new york after sleeping with nate behind blairs back but as things go you have that thought that something is not right here something doesnt add up were missing an information and the payoff at the end of the season is super effective finding out that serena ran away from new york because she thought she killed someone was actually a really good twist and the way it all played out with the menacing arrival of georgina was amazing i love how they handled that reveal how everyone shook out of fear when the name georgina was pronounced and the scene that completely sells it is when serena goes to see chuck after having a huge fight with him and he doesnt want to talk to her but then she shows him a note signed with the letter g and he immediately drops the conflict and lets her in because he knows how serious that is the build up to georgina was absolutely brilliant and she was the perfect antagonist to oppose the tortured mind of serena now i know what youre saying youre like dude whats the problem with serena then from what youre saying she sounds like a pretty compelling character so whats wrong well just shut up im gonna tell you the problem with serena as a character is that as soon as that amazing storyline wraps up in season it becomes very clear very quickly that the writers had no idea what to do with her afterwards serena becomes an insanely boring character and her only function in the show after season is to fall in love with every man she comes across and she either runs away with them in very dramatic storylines or she gets scanned by them some way or another she also turns into a bit of a shitty whiny person all of the clever writing and character development she had in season is completely thrown out the window but the show still really wants you to see her as the likable character from season so she never really faces any repercussions for all the shitty things she does even her relationship with her brother eric is completely put aside the entire reason she comes back to new york and the pilot is because eric tried to commit suicide and she wants to come back and be here for him and take care of him but then she doesnt really interact with him theyre usually in completely separate storylines they never really share scenes like her entire character doesnt reflect the version of her from season anymore so it doesnt work at all she also becomes kind of irrelevant to the overall story of the show especially after season two she goes from being the central character to being just someone whos there all the time and doesnt really contribute to the story she occasionally comes back into the seasons main plot but most of her presence in the show is sort of away from the rest of the cast with some guy until shes forced into a happy ending with dan that doesnt feel earned in the slightest after a while you realize that the only reason you might still like serena is because the character survives on blake livelys natural charisma because shes just amazing in the role even when the character sucks so yeah after season theres actually not that much to say about serena alright lets talk about her best friend now blair waldorf okay so let me preface this here i have a bit of a lovehate relationship with the character of blair waldorf in a sense i think its fair to say that blair is the best character in gossip girl but also that statement doesnt apply to every season let me explain what i mean in my emily and paris video i talked about how the character of emily is annoying because the writers did not realize she was an extremely unlikable person like emily being a selfish condescending and detestable was completely unintentional well i think blair is the antithesis of emily shes designed to be as detestable as possible thats kind of the point and thats why i love her see emily is a terrible person but she thinks shes good blair is a terrible person but she owns it because yeah make no mistakes blair knows shes a bad person and she actually kind of likes that about her shes mean degrading whiny manipulative entitled she blackmails people shes selfish and she will flat out destroy your life with a big smile on her face if she do anything that keeps her from having things her way and when i say destroy your life i mean it she will make sure that you lose your job she will destroy your marriage she will exact revenge on you to the fullest extent of her capabilities and shell even turn to physical violence if she doesnt know what else to do messing with people is kind of her hobby people have no value to her she has respect for nobody and overall shes just kind of an and thats what makes her character so fun at first because a lot of things that dont work with blair as a character come down to a very specific shift in the way the writers handle her blair waldorf is a character that suffers from what i like to call jack sparrow syndrome you see in pirates of the caribbean we are introduced to johnny depps captain jack sparrow we all know who he is no need for introductions jack is an icon of modern cinema son im captain jack sparrow hes heavy however if you know the pirates franchise you know that there is a very visible change in the character that kinda ruins him after the first movie and it all comes down to writing in the first movie jack is presented in a very specific way hes kind of crazy hes a drunk and at first glance he seems completely stupid but also no one seems to be able to catch him and hes one of the most notorious pirates in the world so he cant be that stupid right well throughout the story the movie does a very great job at showing the audience that jack is a drunk and jack is crazy but also jack is likely to always be the smartest person in the room while the drunk full persona is a part of his personality he also uses it as a very clever facade people systematically underestimate jack because they think hes insane but he uses that in his advantage constantly and he outsmarts almost everyone because of it hes not bothered that you think hes an idiot hes counting on you to think hes an idiot because the moment you do he has the advantage you cheated pirate in the first movie every time jack appears to be in a bad situation hes actually the one controlling it hes a master manipulator and a very calculated guy hes crazy yes but hes smarter than you unfortunately though the layers of jacks character are completely dropped in the sequels you see audiences fell in love with jack sparrow for his weird antics so the people behind the movies thought oh people love jack because hes funny and crazy so in the next movies lets just make him even funnier and crazier so after the first film jack turns into a cartoon character hes no longer the intelligent mastermind with a calculated facade no now hes just the drunk guy hes no longer the clever trickster who appears stupid on purpose no now hes just stupid because the writers took the one personality trait that people enjoyed about jack and made it his entire personality in a way he kind of turns into a parody of the original jack like he no longer uses his wits to get himself out of sticky situations now he just gets lucky in the same way a cartoon character would and he barely has any idea whats happening in other words hes reduced to a gimmick and thats exactly how the writers of gossip girl ruin blair waldorf in season one blair is presented as this evil scheming queen bee but theres a lot of logic and depth to her evilness blair is a control freak she only ever feels validated when she is in a position of power thats why she bosses people around and treats them less like people and more like her own personal slaves it makes her feel in control however whenever blair feels that she is not in control of a situation she will do something completely drastic manipulative and extreme to shift the situation and be on top again she lashes out and throws temper tantrums just like a fiveyearold would and the more we learn about her character throughout the season the more her behavior makes sense and shows to have layers we come to learn that blair is actually a very insecure person in desperate need of approval and most of her evilness is driven by this sense of insecurity because its the only way she knows how to cope with it shes always worried that shes not enough in the eyes of her mother shes jealous of serena and is always worried to be living in her shadow she suffered from an eating disorder that left her mentally fragile her father left new york after coming out as gay and she felt abandoned her boyfriend is in love with her best friend and she cant do anything about it and that same best friend also left new york on a wimp without as much as a text to let her know doubling down on her abandonment issues damn it wouldnt stop thats crazy the show does a really good job at telling you that under all that popularity blair is actually very lonely and in a lot of pain and the status of evil queen she created for herself is a very clever mass she puts on to feel in control she uses her power and her privilege as a defense mechanism thats how she protects herself her entire character is about reputation and image in the first season but i feel like the writers lost sight of that just like jack sparrow the people behind the show saw that audiences really enjoyed the quickwitted mean girl aspect of blair so they decided to make it her leading personality trait as a result after season blair is the same toxic and manipulative bully but for no reason its no longer a facade its no longer a defense mechanism thats just who she is now a very surface level evil queen she becomes a very one note character with far less depth than she was allowed to have in season one every bit of complexity she gets to have afterwards is focused on her romance with chuck but as her own character blair loses all of her layers and i actually think thats too bad towards season and i find her character to become a bit repetitive and boring because now that shes been reduced to a gimmick character development is not really something she gets to have and if it wasnt for leighton meester carrying the role as brilliantly as she did i dont think blair would have become the iconic character shes now known as but anyways lets talk about her boyfriend chuck bah chuck bass as a character is kind of a weird anomaly in season one chuck is not exactly a likable character im sure people have already talked at length about how he sexually assaults both serena and jenny and the pilot and i think that was intentional on the writers part from the very start chuck is framed as an irredeemable villain and that kind of embodies what hes like for the entire season hes just a creepy pervy jerk with a lot of money thats kind of what his character is designed to be and hes so one note about it that i think his following storylines were made that way because the writers did not anticipate that he would become a fan favorite so starting in season two the writers just suddenly went oh okay chuck is the main character now and as a result an overwhelming amount of time in the show moving forward is dedicating to fixing chuck so to speak through season one the writers realized that the idea of a relationship between him and blaire was really exciting to the audience so they doubled down on it big time to give him a redemption arc in the first season the main romantic storyline of the show is between dan and serena but starting in season two that spot is mercilessly stolen by chuck and blair they completely overtake the show but the thing is the writers knew they wrote chuck as this awful disgusting villain at first so in season they try so hard to write themselves out of it and make him sympathetic its actually funny how obvious they are with it his mother is suddenly dead even though shes mentioned and very alive in the pilot his dad dies in a tragic accident he gets cheated out of his inheritance by his uncle like its so clear the writers wanted to make him a victim as much as possible to justify his redemption its hilarious in hindsight but its not badly executed either the effort definitely paid off its very hard for me to look past the fact that he used to assault women on the regular and treat them like objects which he still does in future seasons by the way but somehow audiences fell for it girls across the board fell in love with the bad boy turned good storyline and it really made chuck one of the most popular tv characters of all time when i was a teenager every girl i knew wanted to be with chuck bass and every guy i knew wanted to be chuck bass he became a real subject of fascination amongst everyone even people who didnt watch the show the writers really took a huge gamble by making him the main character but it worked and i think part of that praises entirely to the credit of ed westwick he made the character his own in ways that i find completely mindblowing im not saying this lightly but i dont think theres a single actor on this planet who could play chuck bass and give him the same vibe as westwick did he is chuck bass there is no arguing this and i definitely think the reason why his redemption story for everyone is because his portrayal of the character was just next level its just slightly ruined by the fact that hes now using that on ticktock ticktock tell me youve watched gossip girl without actually telling me youve watched gossip girl ill start im joking oh dude tick tock just brings the cringe out of celebrities but if we ignore all the creepy from the first season like most fans do in order to justify liking him chuck is pretty alright as a character i think out of all the main casts hes the only one to have layers after season one so i guess thats why hes the most interesting to people chuck is kind of a dick even after his redemption arc he really wants to be a better man and blah blah blah but hes still a toxic son of a however his desire for growth is admirable but in the end he never really becomes a good person just a slightly less awful one a lot of people are in love with him and are fooled by his charisma but i dont think chuck bass would be a person we appreciate in real life cant say the same for his best friend though nate archibald okay this one is gonna be fairly quick if youre a fan of gossip girl you probably know that there isnt that much to say about nate but thats not to say hes a bad character though in season one nate is weirdly the one with the most relatable storyline in the entire show which is surprising for gossip girl because it doesnt really do relatable you see all of the insanely rich characters in this show really enjoy being rich like theyre living in a bathing in pools of hundred dollar bills and looking down on the less fortunate but when you meet nate hes not exactly happy or thriving hes kind of lost dont get me wrong im sure he enjoys being rich as well but you quickly come to learn that nate never really had any control over his life like he never really got to make choices for himself hes kind of trapped in his circumstances like hes a prisoner of his own privilege every decision in his life is decided by other people mainly his family and he has very little say over what his future will look like hes stuck in a decadelong relationship with blair hes clearly unhappy in because his dad wants to close a business deal with her mother and breaking up with her could ruin that hes being forced to apply and go to a college he doesnt want to go to to pursue a career he doesnt want to pursue and he has no idea what he actually wants to do with his life because he never really had a chance to think for himself hes kind of a puppet and you get the sense that hes lived his entire life on autopilot he has no free will which is kind of sad when you think about it and you feel for him because well nate is a good guy hes the only one of the rich kids who treats people like people hes compassionate and eager to help and while hes very much a part of this messed up old money world deep down he doesnt really feel like he belongs with these people in their practices hes just kind of going through the motions and it all comes crashing down when its revealed that his powerful beloved and respected father is actually a drug addict on the verge of bankruptcy whos guilty of a lot of whitecollar crimes and is one wrong move away from being put behind bars and losing everything and the way this storyline unfolds is actually really well written nate spends most of the season walking on a very thin line between protecting his father and doing the right thing which is going against his father the fact that nate is the one who first gets his dad arrested to force him to go to rehab is actually a compelling moment in the show and it shows a lot about who he is as a person nates original storyline and gossip girl is amazing but then season ends yeah him too hes not immune to the gossip girl post season writing disease just like serena after the first few episodes of season it becomes pretty clear that the writers had no idea what to do with nate which shuts because his initial storyline in season is a direct continuation of the previous one aside from that weird subplot where a middleaged woman is blackmailing him and forcing him to have sex with her for money even though hes underage the idea of nate becoming homeless but being too proud to tell anyone or ask for help is really good on paper it was an interesting thing to explore with a character like him but then he moves in with dan and its all downhill from there let me put it this way if gossip girl was a stage play nate archibald would be a tree hes always there but hes never doing anything hes a quirky decoration hes in the show to look pretty the most notable thing that happens to him after season one is that he eventually starts dating an underage girl in season six and its really weird and gross but thats about it nate becomes a glorified extra that has no impact on the story and i dont understand why he was there for all six seasons but i really like chase crawford so im not gonna complain at least he makes nate likeable alright lets move on vanessa abrams shes pointless from the moment she arrives in the show and then she disappeared in season four and i didnt even notice next jenny humphrey all right so heres my big and popular opinion with gossip girl i know a lot of fans hate jenny and i get it because i do think shes annoying as hell but i will admit that i struggled to see her as the despicable villain the fans and the writers made her out to be i think the point of jennys story and gossip girl is to show what happens when you let yourself be consumed by ambition and for all intents and purposes i think its pretty well done yes the writers try a little too hard to villainize her but theres still weight to her path when we meet jenny shes this cute and adorable little girl who dreams of becoming a fashion designer and the show makes a point of showing us early on that she actually has a lot of talent but jenny also becomes power hungry and shes often frustrated because people far less talented than her get more attention than she does because of their social status shes limited by her lack of privilege and it kind of makes her crazy as soon as she gets a little bit of power and recognition especially in the fashion field she gets drunk on it she gets ahead of herself and wants more and as a result she can turn into a bit of a backstabbing she wants everything right now shes not willing to be patient and build success over time because she knows she has talent and she thinks that because she has talent she deserves instant recognition but thats not how life works theres a very fine line between knowing your worth and being arrogant and entitled and jenny definitely crosses that line more than once the fact that she thought she could take on eleanor waldorf on her own is a perfect example of her getting carried away by her own ambition shes ready to make an enemy of everyone around her including her own family if it means getting what she wants and if you ask me the writers do a lot of interesting things with her that perfectly showcase how this idea of only living for the grind is not a very healthy mentality to live by and the way her mental health becomes a victim of that ideology is kind of powerful in my opinion jennys desire to conquer is a genuinely compelling character trait and it makes her a pretty effective rival to blair who even admits that jenny is her only worthy opponent because everyone underestimates jenny or little jay as they call her and while she makes a number of mistakes along the way she does prove to everyone in spectacular fashion that she is not somebody to mess with and thats pretty cool to me despite all of her flaws the show does make a point of showing that shes strong but with all that said the reason why i dont understand the hatred people have for jenny is that she doesnt really ever do anything that is even half as awful as the things chuck or blair do on the regular i mean yeah shes a bit of an she does some real dick moves throughout the show but like none of it is that crazy like she steals a dress from the closet of her friends mom and sells it she crashes lilys benefit to advertise her fashion line she becomes a drug dealer for like three minutes and she sleeps with chuck i guess like she does dumb but her actions are pretty tame compared to other characters in the show i mean come on chuck sexually assaulted girls left and right including jenny herself he sold blair to his uncle to get his hotel back blair ruined the life of her teacher because she was mad that she got a b in her class serena filmed herself having sex with dan without his consent or his knowledge she also witnessed the guy having an overdose and she just left him there lily vanderwoodson forged her own daughters confession willingly sending an innocent man to prison on false sexual assault charges just so that serena could go to private school theres a whole lot of seriously up things happening in this show but youre telling me that youre drawing the line at jenny skipping classes as i rewatched the show i realized that jenny is actually one of the least problematic characters in gossip girl the only reason shes so hated is because the writers went above and beyond to make her an obvious villain but in context shes not jenny is whiny and annoying but if you really put her next to her peers she definitely has the moral high ground shes not that bad guys you need to give her a break ah fine lets talk about the other humphrey now rufus humphrey im kidding dan humphrey okay i know i know if youve been following me and you saw this video pop in your subscription feed youre probably here to hear me talk about dan humphrey for several reasons but lets not get ahead of ourselves here theres a lot to say about him and thats why i decided to talk about him last i think i start by saying that dan in season one is genuinely a dope character this isnt over hey any time man that one black guy looks a little lonely oh my god he dont exchange my others and i mean that both within the context of their show and from a writing standpoint i dont know if thats a controversial statement so dont come at me but i like him in season one and the reason why is because the writers made sure to make him likeable while giving him realistic flaws hes not perfect but he is a good person he can be a little judgmental and hes shown to have a bit of a temper at times but overall hes kind of a chill guy whos just trying to have a place in this weird world he doesnt really belong in he feels like a genuine human being his relationship with serena really works in this romeo and juliet we come from
dBNifSDo3qI,albertas danielle smith breaks with premiers on trump retaliation power politics,okay the countrys premier have been meeting with prime minister justin trudeau uh throughout the last several hours the meeting has ended now the goal was to devise a joint response to donald trumps potential terrorists and possibly a retaliation because as early as monday the president elect could slap a tariff on all canadian goods new brunswick premier susan holt was in those meetings and she joins us now uh from old city hall here in ottawa premier holt its good to speak with you thanks for being here thanks for having me david uh he was a very united front with an accept notable exception today uh what does daniel smith the premier of albertas refusal to sign on to this common plan say about where things stand for team canada in dealing with donald trump well i think they show that team canada is unified in a shared goal we are going to fight these tariffs and we all agree that the outcome that were looking for is to eliminate them ideally prevent them from happening and eliminate them as quickly as possible uh none of us are are excited about the prospect of tariffs on our own economy and so we all agree on that as well uh i think there was real strong collaboration and discussion uh and i think everyone agreed on the next steps uh and so i think that thats a thats a great place to work from i im being told that uh you looked at not a dollar ford dooll retaliation against the full value of what donald trump has threatened because that would be enormous and and and even more crippling than what the might do but its somewhere around billion canadian dollars in tariffs that were discussed by the premier today bloomberg now reporting billion which i assume is the us value is that kind of where youve landed uh we put a lot of different options on the table uh and identified what our best first step would be should the tariffs come into place and its going to depend on what those tariffs look like because we still dont know whether its going to be a broadbased tariff across the economy or whether it will be applied specifically to certain good and so we have a number of different options available to us in response depending on the severity of the action from uh from the trump administration and so uh we discussed all sorts of options of all sorts of different values but we need to see what the president is actually going to do first and then were ready to respond accordingly are you worried at all though uh premier by what daniel smith has said because you know even fran lago said that youve agreed not to exclude anything right that that you want to have as united a front with as many options as possible on the table doug ford said you need to think about region but country comes first because hes coming for all of us and its quite frankly his auto sector as the prime minister pointed out that was directly targeted by president trump but but but if the premier of alberta is saying dont touch our energy that creates domestic challenges as well as these crossb challenges are you worried about what this does to unity and your ability to respond to this well i can understand the feeling right each of us as premier and and as doug ford and go demonstrated we have unique economies and theres different things that will hurt us in different ways and all of our instincts are to protect our provinces i certainly am here to fight for new brunswickers and for whats in their best interest whats in their best interest is a strong canada and is eliminating the tariffs so we have to make sure that we have the tools available to us um even if just the threat of the use of those tools could be effective in uh in the fight against these tariffs and so uh we know what we want to do first we know what we dont want to do unless we have to do it uh but there is right now we cant predict uh whats going to happen with the president and we need to be prepared to react in the way that is going to limit the damage on the canadian economy and eliminate the tariffs as quickly as possible thats our shared goal and i i believe premier smith shares those same objectives but but do you think her objection uh to the to to using alberta oil removes that the threat of that from the toolbox for team canada that this is not something that can credibly be argued because of this uh this descent from her to well i think team canada is going to be meeting on a very regular basis including next week as soon as we know whether the tariffs have been put in place and what they look like were going to be back together to devise the exact approach that were going to take then and then when its time uh to to take another step then were all going to be back together talking about what we can agree to do at that time um and so i think its possibly premature uh i think we are all unified in the conversation today were all unified in the next steps were unified in the objective uh and we all recognize the need to support each others provinces uh and that the best way to do that is to work as one team canada well certainly we heard from the prime minister today that no sector or region should carry an unfair burden and thats sort of a core principle uh that you all agreed to there uh how how reassured are you on that that theres the financial weight uh or the financial resources there excuse me to to to compensate affected sectors affected provinces and affected workers should have come to that well that is something that we talked about today and theres more conversation to be had on the kind of supports that we can put in place through the federal government and in partnership with the provinces to support new brunswickers and canadians uh who might see their jobs impacted or their companies impacted and so uh we have to we have to look at the impact that that could have on our economy that kind of loss of jobs and work and how we best support it as we would do during any other time i think i think the kind of package that was put together and proposed by the federal government is strong is strategic its focused on how we can um in inject the most pain um to the targeted and americans that reduces the risk and the impact to the canadian economy uh i think thats the right strategy i think the federal government has done good work on that and we look forward to working with them on the supports that we can put um should the tariffs have uh their projected impact on on new brokers and on canadians okay well one last question premier uh after a lot of skepticism about the border plan uh doug ford was briefed on it yesterday by minister leblon he called it phenomenal which was not a phrase weve heard many premier uttering about the federal response what is your assessment of the border plan as sort of articulated today uh by by minister mcginty minister miller and what you heard in private from the prime minister well i i share uh premier fords views its a strong plan um its its focused on the kinds of things that are going to benefit canadians and help uh improve our security honestly my concerns with the border particularly that new brunswick shares with maine is more of whats coming into our country from the us than whats going the other way um but theyve put together a thoughtful program thats going to help us get at that as well uh and put resources where we need them to keep new bruners and canadians safe new bronic premier susan holt i always appreciate the time thanks for being here on a busy day yeah thanks david okay so as we discussed the prime minister and the premier were hoping to come out of their meeting with the united response to donald trumps terror threat but one premier daniel smith says she is not on board with the federal governments plan in a statement the alberta leader says the premier agreed on several strategies however she writes federal government officials continue to publicly and privately float the idea of cutting off energy supply to the united states and opposing export tariffs on alberta energy and other products to the united states until these threats cease alberta will not be able to fully support the federal governments plan in dealing with the threatened tariffs smith posted the statement while the prime minister and the premier were giving their closing press conference heres some of that reaction protect your jurisdiction the country comes first canada is a priority and i dont believe in jeopardizing one sector or another uh premier smith oil is onos auto sector when donald trump comes at us hes not going to say well lets lets not worry about ontario theyre good people or or alberta hes coming full tilt at canadians as a whole the interest of this country means were going to have to look at everything we can and well make sure that its fair across the country but nothing can be off the table if the uh us continues to choose to move forward with these uh punishing tariffs okay its time to bring in the power panel to talk about what has been a busy day here in ottawa amanda alo is a former liberal party communications strategist jordan lenit is a former ndp strategist and here with me in the studio tim powers is a former strategist for conservative parties and charelle eelin is the managing editor of the hill times uh good to see you gang on a busy day amanda start with you i i wonder um of the premiers are fully on board what does danielle smiths descent do to the team canada approach here what are your thoughts on this well theres nothing like weakening your negotiating position by negotiating against yourself when its tminus days to inauguration so you know i think its problematic and i think um the premiers you know premier holt sort of skirted that answer a bit i think premier ford was much more direct about it and again this is kind of the best of premier ford that we see and that is country is first and that we need every negotiating chip on the table that nothing can be off the table at this time and i think both the premier premier ford as well as uh prime minister reiterated that and i think the message was really clear if we want to promote a robust healthy mutually beneficial trading partnership then we have to make sure that when we get to the table that we have all of the retaliatory measures and tools at our disposal to keep that alive and well so i think her going rogue is very challenging but she telegraphed this she came back from mar maralago saying that she was looking for that carve out so its not really a surprise its just an unfortunate turn events at this you know first ministers meeting uh that happened today jordan uh what do you think this does the canadas ability to to have these threats against the us administration the incoming us administration because this is going this is going to inflame a potential domestic audience for sure with the premier saying this yeah i think its hugely harmful and the reality is that energy in particular particularly oil and gas are really canadas biggest lever when it comes to confronting the american tariffs so if you take that off the table our negotiating position is significantly weakened i think whats really troubling here is that youre seeing premier smith opening up fronts almost on a national unity basis here shes asking for alberta to be exempted from tariffs that would be really applied across the country these arent things that would be singling alberta out and i think what shes doing here is really harming the overall chances that canada is going to be able to successfully confront the tariff threat theres just no scenario in which alberta wins or is successful and getting some sort of exemption um and and the rest of canada loses and thats going to be good for albertans thats not real so i think shes making actually a pretty reckless move here and its one that that really puts the whole country at risk tim uh you know we both come from an oil producing place as a big part of the economy andrew fury we spoke to him earlier said i dont want to do it but its got to be there as an op because the threat is is so dire daniel smiths outling on that well i guess after spending the weekend with kevin oir the whisperer of trump for canada were so lucky hes in that role and the prime and the president elect shes uh believing that its better to appear chaotic than not look theres some logic i think to her position its not like the premier of alberta whether it be daniel smith or ralph klein or anybody is easily likely going to say yes um put a paraon oil and gas i think she for her own domestic purposes she probably at first blush has to do this and if the federal government does it she can say well i stood firm or tried to stand firm on all of that uh i think what to watch will be something jordan alluded to how forceful will she become if we if and or but we get to that particular place right now its probably fine to be like this its going to be fascinating tomorrow though with governor carney announcing in uh edmonton to see how he responds to this particular question because part of um mr carnes uh offering is going to be hey i can give some voice to the west and im im from the west but i suspect he will answer as others have answered that will stand for c but you know is is it fine to have this position now when when the call from her and other premiers is its time to show national leadership its time to pull together its time to speak with one voice and everyone has said i dont think its fine for canada but i think she thinks its fine for her her domestical audience in al okay charer what are your thoughts on this because because doug ford gave a pretty strong rebuke and as the prime minister pointed out the only industry thats been specifically threatened by donald trump is the auto industry in ontario and doug ford said you know we got to put country ahead of province yeah it listening to this whole thing in the during the press conference today kind of gave me that and then seeing um premier smiths tweet come through while the press conference was going on made me think back to the g uh summit in chara of president trump left early didnt sign the commun and then or did sign it but then blew it up blew it up and then from his plane started you know chirping everybody that was left back in the room and it gave me that same sense its almost like shes playing a little bit with that same playbook it you know she shes gone shes gone down to kind of bend the knee a little um and you know speak to president trump directly or presidentelect trump directly you you kind you cant help but wonder if shes already you know in those face toface meetings gave him given him the the assurance that this is off the table um and so she now has to stand firm in doing that by you know removing herself and alberta and the oil and gas and everything that goes along with that from this conversation because she wants to remain in that position there its not surprising as was said before that shed take this position um but given the fact that everybody else is so united on it um it is really interesting that she would cast herself so specifically as you know as the lone wolf in this in this negotiation but you know its interesting amanda because i spoke with scott mo um earlier this week and like no fan of the prime minister lets be honest right and he has said look we have to say all options are there because it erodes our bargaining position to say otherwise but that he has been reasonably assured by federal officials that anything to do with oil exports or export tariffs thats really far down the list of options like things have to be pretty bad for them to go to that but you cant say were never going to consider it so its notable to me that saskatchewan and newf labrador the other two sort of energy economies that theyre on board and saying this is an option but its not the first option yeah i mean its notable but its also the right thing to do like imagine sabotaging the negotiation efforts ahead of the negotiation you have to have all of the tools in the toolbox right yes absolutely you have to have all the tools and and uh you know charelle just on your point like does this take a big tool out of it if alberta says dont use our prime industry which is such a a significant part of the canadian economy of of course it does because you can clearly say oil is something that the president has presidentelect has talked about as you know when he refers to canada subsidizing uh or sorry the us subsidizing canada um so this is something that he is interested in so it makes sense to you know keep it at the forefront of his mind but at the same time you cant just remove something so specifically that everybody else says hey we need this as you know in our in our arsenal tim the next time were going to hear from the premier of alberta shes going to be in washington for the inauguration um shes not doing media interviews to explain this she just issued the statement and uh because shes on vacation um its interesting she can interrupt it to go see donald trump but not to uh you know come here in person for this and then speak to the choice she has made here today well dont forget again i i i do not think what she was in the interest of canada but was certainly in the interest of her political challenges and opportunities in alberta she certainly has an alberta too people who will have a more favorable view of the president elect and some the positions that hes taking as chaotic and unnerving as they may be so shes letting her domestic political agenda drive it and dont forget why shes doing that uh the man she succeeded jason kenny took a lot of grief for not fighting hard enough for the oil industry and the like and the alberta conservative party does a better job than the current liberal party at eating their own so shes putting her survivalist tendencies first
ayknk3cUiHQ,more than just political gossip,and welcome to washington unplugged im bob schieffer the this weekend the headline from game change by mark halperin and john heilmans new book with was harry reids racist comments but today we find out more from within this text from the clintons relationship to the kennedys to obama and biden well talk about it all with our chief legal correspondent jan crawford and our political consultant mark ambender who joins me in the studio now uh let me start with you first mark the big headline that we all reported on over the weekend of course was the remark that harry reid made about uh barack obama being a lightskinned negro with no negro accent now that was going to help him they said a lot more in this book i must say its its chock full of of revelations i think to be honest um a a a quotation in the book attributed or a a quotation attributed to president clinton in a private conversation with senator ted kennedy where clinton says something to the effect of you know five years ago this guy speaking about obama would have been bringing his coffee that strikes me as more objectionable than anything harry reid might have said this is coming from the former president of the united states and and what we know of this comment is it apparently got ted kennedy whos spent a lifetime fighting for civil rights so exercised that not only did he endorse president obama but he went out of his way to link obama to the legacy of his brothers and also jan there is also the comment that hillary clinton made to barack obama when he called her and asked her to be secretary of state and she comes up and says well you know i cant control him and at some point hes going to be a problem talking about her own husband we dont hear that much in politics no we dont and i have to say first of all i just think its incredible the publicity that this book has gotten i mean for these authors and i think it shows you know obviously some of the great stuff in it and of course mark i reported some of that it was embargo this book and then he what youre at this bookstore at midnight on friday night i dont have much of a life yeah and so he starts leaking some of this stuff out there late friday night and we saw everything blow up starting on saturday but you know its the interesting thing and some of the things like that mark was just talking about is how so much of this book is viewed which i dont know that thats surprising through the prism of race you know now what did bill clinton mean by that you know did he really was he really talking about barack obama as a black man five years ago when you know would be bringing us coffee or did he mean that he was just so junior right you know a former state senator but again i mean thats what and obviously were seeing that too with some of the comments from senator reid well what about these comments from senator reid uh you know uh trent lot has suddenly become a big part of this because people remember when trent lott said about strom thurman you know if wed all voted for him we probably wouldnt be having the problems that were having in this country uh i saw that it was at a birthday party for strom thurman and the fact is trent lott had said that as you know inexplicable as it was for him to say it he had actually said that before im not sure that trent lott even understood what he was saying when he said that he was just trying to make an old man feel good or at least thats what a lot of his friends say but the white house totally threw him overboard they were already having problems with him he had to resign the leadership it appears jan that harry reid at least as of today is going to hang on as the leader of the democrats in the senate for the simple reason and the practical reason barack obama needs it right and i mean as you pointed out this morning on on the early show i mean thats a slightly different situation than the way george bush was viewing trent lott back when he made those comments but you know i think you know clearly uh when you look at it on their face theyre different you know trent lot was kind of pandering to you know some old white racist guy saying well the country would be a lot better off if everybody had followed our lead and voted for strom thurman you know and what we see from harry reid is kind of almost analyzing barack obamas blackness and you know basically was he kind of the right black guy to be president of the united states and trying to decide whether or not he was going to support him early on i mean thats more i think along the lines of you know when we saw back when jackie robinson was going to be going into the major leagues and they kind of settled on him as the right kind of player to to integrate baseball uh so you know while on the surface it seems very different i do think that theres some legitimacy to talking about whether this is a serious racial problem for harry reid theres an undercurrent there uh that kind of focuses on on race and race in modern day america and what both men trent lot pandering to i think an old white racist what both men think about race and the way americans view race at this point harry reid obviously looking at modern day america which brings me to this point uh mark you know some people are dismissing this book as a lot of political gossip i think its a pretty serious uh political book and because i think sometimes we learn a lot from gossip oh we learn a lot from these remarks like this apparently and and jan you were among the first report this was a comment that harry reid made to these authors as he was trying to explain why he was urging people to get behind the obama campaign that he was the right kind of thats kind of the candidate thing i think that kind of helps us understand a little something about inter interpersonal conflicts and relationships drive political change more than just about any other factor and then thats one of the lessons of this book and you can criticize the book for being gossipy but what one persons gossip is is you know with someone elses deeply held opinion in this case a lot of things we heard as gossip or rumored during the campaign turned out to be true had we known them they would have changed the race at the time and kudos to these reporters for forgetting you know getting the facts the palace to back them up well and you know speaking of that we havent even talked about the palin stuff yeah i mean looking forward i thought some of that was just incredible and then we saw uh you know the top campaign advisor last night on minutes saying it you know maybe one thing for harry reid to say it to the authors but then weve got steve schmidt coming out and saying it to the world on minutes talking about sarah palin and how she thought this was all her candidacy was part of gods plan and how she had you know called joe biden in the debate the reason she called him joe is because she kept calling him oh biden i mean i think some of that is obviously could have a real lasting effect on that persons candidacy in the future if theres going to be one else one would say about sarah palin for american journalists she is the gift that just keeps on giving and shes also its also a fascinating fascinating story i think dont you and and and you know uh we and i still even even this book we still dont have a completely satisfactory answer as to why john mccain in his heart made that decision went with his goal we cant you know if we could take a a cat scan of john mccains gut at the time when that decision was made maybe we could we could learn something but that to me is the fundamental question we still dont have an answer to well didnt dick cheney say it was reckless i mean thats another another revelation you know i think a lot of people agree on are so eager to unburden themselves just a couple of years after the fact of something like this thats well its good to talk about trauma it helps you procrastinate maybe i want to thank both of you for being with us this morning thats it for watching unplugged today catch us again tomorrow on cbsnewscom bob chief were here

e9SwhgnY2rk,labour is incompetent jeremy kyle discusses the latest politics news,benedict spence very good afternoon how are you my friend im well thanks j how you doing uh good um where do you want to start israel and hamas have reached a ceasefire deal to end months of war the israelis will say quite rightly i believe that hamas is destroyed and on its knees hamas will say that the world is uh anti what israels done theyve committed war crimes donald trump will arrive on monday and say see i told him i open the gates of hell its all sorted biden will say its all done thats my legacy the reality is we are inching closer to peace benedict i mean for the time being hamas has been devastated its not gone away though there is still enough there for it to be of a major concern donald trump youre right to point this out donald trump needs this win because one of the big things that sort of went against the biden administration was lots of very pro palestinian democrat voters and muslim americans uh criticizing the biden administration for not being able to strongarm israel and stopping what it was doing in gaza um it lost a lot of support on that basis whereas donald trump was able to pick up a lot of the those votes by saying ill get a deal done um in the first week and it looks as if that might be happening and from what you hear whats going on behind the scenes it does sound like there was quite a bit of strong arming going on from the trump incoming trump administration the reasons for that are very obvious he needs to say uh to to his voters i got an easy early win especially seeing as ukraine might prove a little bit more difficult interesting though it tells you it tells you everything that you need to know certainly what im keen to do other networks arent doing this they theyre doing a big thing on this i think we need to just watch this detail as it come out as it comes out we have to bear in mind that the israelis their government is not voting on this tomorrow more details will emerge youre right lets be honest the israelis could vote against it heram mask has pull out at the last minute we dont know but that is where we are at and us president elect donald trump says we have a deal uh they will be released shortly lets talk about um domestically something that is causing me um i dont know not to sleep at night im im starting to get really quite wound up about this how bloody incompetent is our prime minister three more examples of the flipflopping idiot today or the pilic as i now call him um the chos islands a british colony four years nothing to do with marias strategically for the order of the world a very important part uh of of of the military strength of the western world for not only the americans but also the europeans starma in his globalist way has decided some weeks ago or months ago to give it away he and his foreign secretary to micius and also because they havent got much money to give him billion pound maishas quite close to china several cynical people saying why would you do that thats utterly ludicrous uh today hes ditched attempts to get this done before the trump rem returns on monday saying and i quote uh wed like the tr president elect to look it over well the presidentelect is going to tell him where to shove this deal as far as the sun dont shine because he wants the cher silence and so do we this is starma yet again flipflopping because hes as weak as anything isnt he im unbelievably weak i mean the thing with this is maius might well have shot themselves in the foot here by after having got this deal secured you know they get ownership of the jos islands uh we get a year lease of diego garcia and they get billion they basically turned around and went you know what we reckon we can shake these people down for a little bit more lets get the money up and lets get that lease down from years to years oh and also lets have it included as part of the nuclear nonproliferation zone so the us cant actually you know land any bs there i think theyve overplayed their hands slightly and i think it says a lot that starma and labor were prepared to still run with this deal um even on those terms but the point is the only thing that labor could turn around and say was good about this deal was weve secured the future of the base on diego garcia for a century once thats down to years and no nuclear capabilities there at all all of a sudden you kind of sat there going right what was the point of that you know even if that was the objective youve now lost that and now its the its frankly it is humiliating that the president of the united states can then turn around and go i might veto this deal um although slightly less humiliating i suppose than donald trump just going do you know what were just going to take this island because you people dont seem to know what to do with it but i suppose there is a slight shink of success here for starm or at least how he will view it really which is that he will be able to say look i wanted to go ahead with this deal but the president of the united states is on a bit of an acquisitional streak with greenland and panama all of these things i i didnt have any say and hell hell hell try to paint this to his own voters as look this is that nasty old donald trump throwing his weight around but weve got to play nice with the americans because we have to be the grownups and we have to be diplomatic well so no acknowledgement that its the wrong decision not not not any acknowledgement from starma that actually its the wrong decision giving away you know british islands that for for for money that we cant afford when we cant afford to look after our own people thats ludicrous theres billion pounds that could pay for farmers and pension marius doesnt need that theyll probably give it to to china anyway thats a ludicrous way of looking at it but the thing is we have to remember here k stama david lamy a lot of the members of the labor party front bench they are human rights lawyers and they view the world through the prism not of what is best for the uk but what is best for human rights do you think they hate the uk i dont think they hate the uk i think they dont care about the uk i think its worse i think that theyre prepared to cast it into the wilderness cast like as long as human rights comes first then britain is expendable i think that thats actually at least if there was hatred there that at least you could say theres some sort of motivation i think they just dont care well listen this is really interesting because the next thing of course is this outrage caused today as he quest his quest of human rights gathered some pace there was this piece of legislation to be introduced by uh the tourist at the back end of their their government which basically was dealing with the troubles in northern ireland and it was dealing with you know the rights of soldiers and and it turned out this morning i mean there we go again flipflop flip flop that that that one of the pieces of legislation being slashed by this government would have resulted in potentially the head of the shin faine organization who spent some time in custody when he was accused of being involved in the bombing of innocent people and being part of the ira jerry adams could if this is thrown out sue the british government i asked the bloody taxpayer for hundreds of thousands of pounds did you hear the call on mike mike grs breakfast show i missed that im a have you have you got it for me right because i im playing this every hour because i think its really important this is a call from a guy called andy whose neighbor was a serving soldier listen to what happened to him but more importantly listen to the anger benjamin in benedict even in its because of net and aru listen to the anger in this mans voice play it ames please i myself never served in the forces but my good friend and next door neighbor did and he was in the raw marines and he was he played for the band and in when the ira de ated a bomb and killed of his friends and and colleagues and injured odd others hes now left on the shelf ptsd alcoholism and hes basically got nothing and starma wants to start giving money to jerry adams i tell you what mike it makes my bloody blood boil it really does understandable understandable the frustration people have served for this country and put their necks on the line feeling that theyre second class citizens but that in fact is rather reminiscent of of what so many people feel now uh what do we get this afternoon benedict we get him doing a uturn old old starm going no no i dont want jerry adams to get compensation you are so right this quest to appease and and be a human rights lawyer and do everything for everybody but real victims and real people who need help will be the undoing if it isnt the undoing of them already for goodness sake it will be and that is exactly what were talking about right here is that certain peoples human rights because it sort of meets a certain legal cr they have to be prioritized and this is the sort of thing that i i agree i you i believe starma when he says i dont want jerry adams to get compensation he hasnt thought about it in those terms thats the problem he hasnt thought about it for two seconds how this would look and then too late when the news comes out he goes oh this isnt good im going to have to do so im going to this is my point youd know more than me why is there nobody around this pillock or or or or government saying thats how its going to be perceived thats how it sounds thats how it looks yeah the problem is that the labor party is i mean its complet the modern labor party is completely deaf and blind to what its core constituent should be it is completely lost sight of its core mission um you know i i know it might be going back a little bit it might be a bit unfashionable but the point of the labor movement was to stand up for and represent the urban working class of this country they were the urban and the working people of this country they simply dont do that anymore the working people the ordinary people come last because they that is why that is why they lost in this assumption if your labor that youre always going to have that workingclass vote boris johnson won it by talking to that red wool this election they got them back but i just on a daily basis i want to throw into the mix before you go two stories that send me through the roof um the bbc today criticized again uh benedict for hiring a new boss at its world news operation who previously when he was in charge in canada of the bbc and bear in mind that george aki is the new head of editorial quality and clients at bbc world service instructed all of his journalists to not call hamas a terrorist organization again really honestly i mean i you know whereas i say that the the lead labor leadership doesnt hate britain it just simply doesnt care i do think its slightly different for certain elements of the bbc i think the bbc not the organization as a whole but a lot of people who work within it do actually view british culture western culture western history as some sort of fundamentally very evil thing and they see everything through the prism of that word decolonization and the other one justice and you know again this this goes back to actually how we got to the position with the chos islands is that you know lots of people were sort of championing this on the basis that it was about decolonization and reparations well theres far too much of that frankly that goes on at the bbc and when it comes specifically to the is issue of israel and palestine very stupid people with no concept of history look at the fact that what has been happening very recently is you know is sort of viewed through a prism that paints israel as the bad white colonizers and the palestinians as the noble savages you know that old trope that i thought we done away with about half a century ago and that therefore there is only one morally good side and one morally bad side and its the you know and its the white people the the jewish people that are the bad ones and that no matter what happens from the palestinian side that it must always be thus and its that blind spot i think at the bbc that as you say it just grs with people and it makes ordinary people think they are not impartial they are not actually acting in our best interest we were talking about the government of this country this is the broadcasting company of this country that we are forced by law to pay for if we want to view any i cant i cant see that surviving i think this is another nail in the coffin for the for the bbc license fe i think its an absolute bleeding joke im so sorry that we were supposed to get you on in two hours late i i dont take any blame for this i blame ryan squirly whos now looking very hacked off uh benedict thank you so much indeed benedict spence conservative commentator talking about all things that have been happening now
q1SxrONXp3M,brilliant monologue usa israel palestine politics uk news canada comedy lol congress,and while he was in israel a book of his was released and his title was very controversial in israel and the title of the book was palestine peace not aarth and while he was there jimmy carter said i want to go to the palestinian territory i will never forget the images of a former american president walking with little to no security while thousands of palestinians were cheering them on and when i saw that picture it brought tears to my eyes i i said i dont know if thats a good president but that right there i am sure is a great man it made me feel very proud so donald trump i know you watch the show please do better next time do not forget your humanity and please have empathy for displaced people whether theyre in the palisades or palestine thank you very much and good luck
5ZL1Q50-36Q,what executive orders will trump issue on day,welcome back to america decides not sure if youve heard about this but on monday presidentelect trump is going to be inaugurated for a second term talk about that kevin sheridan republican strategist kevin you are the winning side sketch out what the first week looks like of the trump administration i think it is shock and awe what does that mean it sounds like theres going to be a lot of activity on executive orders on the border on immigrants who are here illegally now especially criminals i think you will see probably a lot of energy executive orders on drilling and land that he wants to potentially open up i could see him halting wind projects hes been talking a lot about the whales so i could see they have had four years to plan for this one its going to be a lot different than i think they have got the personnel in place i think they are ready to go this transition from a republican perspective has looked much different there is very little republican opposition anymore almost none and they know that theyve got to deliver on the mandate that the american people just gave them and i think he is going to get started right away and that question about loyalty to trump has artie been asked and answered you are not in if you have any clouds hanging over you on that question right yeah i think hes got the personnel he wants his candidates for the cabinet are going through really well i dont see any of them going down right now obviously we still have rfk in a couple more to go but it is looking like its going to be off to a very good start for him when you hear words like shock and awe from a democratic perspective what does that instill in you i think it instills a lot of concern not just from a democratic perspective but for the million people that voted for kamala harris for the millions more that they have voted for donald trump but did not vote for the version of donald trump that we are hearing saber rattling about it really depends on how you define this mandate that donald trump believes he has i dont think it is a mandate to go and turn communities against each other and pull people out of synagogues and churches and schools and places of worship and workplaces and turn neighborhoods against each other i think it was for cheaper eggs and common sense that was the mandate so if donald trump chooses to stray away from that mandate i think politically he will be punished for it he is enjoying the honeymoon this time around like he didnt last time around i think it will be very shortlived if he this mandate when he says cheaper eggs and common sense and also talks about the potential of immigration raids and schools churches places of work is that what were going to see or do you think other things will be on the immigration front that are more selective and less politically potent or injurious to trump yeah i think the sweet spot for getting this started the right way is probably making a very much about the criminals that are here anybody that has got a criminal record anybody that violates the law while they are in the united states they should be gone after right away i think that is where you are going to see the biggest focus on them and then you are going to see a lot of different measures taken so that people choose to deport themselves we talked a lot about self deportation going way back to you remember that it has actually started to even happen now you have seen reports of it what is the second pitch after he goes and does the shock and awe immigration what is his plan how is he going to make life more affordable for the american people how is he going to actually govern tax cuts for the middle class govern as a politician it is easy to campaign as an opposition politician it is not easy to govern donald trump has not proven he can do that he cut regulation the first time he lowered taxes for the middle class last time the economy took off i think youre going to see the same thing this time that is what republicans have been working on with the bill they are crafting right now youre going to see it legislatively some of it regulatory i think it is all going to take off next week how much of this is going to depend on trumps working relationship with house republicans and house republican leadership and the very nearly historic not more than years have we had a majority of either party as small as this one is going to be if they cannot get something passed or if one person holds them up or two people decide they want to tank something it is going to be on them trump is going to have to mobilize the maga base there is an entire maga media network out there very powerful with republican primary voters if any of these guys dont want to keep their jobs maybe they are a skunk at the party but i cannot see a lot of that right now there just doesnt seem to be the will for it so this is what it looks like i just want to say politically what field he looks like donald trump is talking about withholding relief aid to los angeles and tying it to this giant reconciliation bill which is going to be a christmas tree for our friends a block over on k street i dont think this is going to wear well i get that people are excited and full of vigor because donald trump is more popular now than he has ever been but i dont know if this is going to wear well three months and six months again we have never seen donald trump govern as a majority politician he is a resultsoriented guy if nothing else he knows hes got to get the economy fixed hes got to get inflation down hes got to fix the border if he doesnt do those things youre right how do you think this tiktok thing plays out with trump coming in and reversing he is now a fan of it was to find a grandiose deal how do you see that going sounds like they are going to try to get a delay on it there is a day window you can sort of delay harsh implementation maybe use that i think you will twist every arm he can to try to get the chinese to sell there is no shortage it says a lot about tiktok and the chinese communist party that they are not selling even though they are buyers out there for it what does that mean what do you think it means they are using it as spyware this is interesting to me this fits into a owing narrative joe biden talked about the oligarchy he talked about the robber barons lets just speak plainly there are going to be billionaires that the three richest men in the world are going to be surrounding donald trump when he takes the oath of office and i dont think that the american people signed up for this it is how you define the mandate the american people and the people who voted for donald trump they sign up for elon musk and mark zuckerberg and jeff bezos and peter thiel who is sponsoring jd vance to control everything these are often partners in the history of our country they are not just financiers coming in however george soros made his money there are billionaires on both sides if they have something to offer elon musk is a very
71pqHtG3Kdw,mexico preps retaliation list over us tariffs power politics,well just like canada mexico is also bracing for an economic hit from donald music trump mexican president claudia sham bom has laid out her countrys plan to meet one of trumps demands to reduce their imports from china canada meanwhile is throwing a little over a billion dollars at the border to appease trump the key question remains for both countries are these efforts enough kenneth smith ramos is mexicos former chief negotiator for the modernization of nafta and now a partner at aegon and he joins me now its good to see you again sir thanks for being here thank you very much david for the invitation there is a great deal of anxiety in this country about what could come on monday and absolutely no certainty about what could come on monday what what what is the mood from the mexican perspective right now well i think its uh very similar i think the uh mexican government and the mexican private sector is sort of ab bracing for whatever scenar we may face beginning next week with the arrival of president trump i think the mexican government has been working on a strategy which is twofold which is on the one hand to really be vigilant that the usmca is not violated uh president shane bound has been clear in stating that uh if the us unilaterally increases tariffs on mexican exports that would represent a violation of the usmca and that mexico would have to retaliate so i know for a fact that there is work going going on in mexico on a potential retaliation list taking as an example the uh the lists and the retaliation that mexico has uh enacted in the past in the previous administration for president trump and in previous years visa the united states so thats thats one side and on the other side you know the key objective for mexico is to basically try to diffuse the tariff threat right now and that involves without a doubt what also the mexican government has been saying which is establishing a positive foreign policy uh dialogue with the united states on key issues such as immigration and security drug trafficking so i think thats those are the areas where the the government is is is focusing the efforts as well as dealing with what will come later which is the entire discussion on usmca in its review in what role does china play in those discussions etc yeah it sounds very similar to what canada has done though the the issues with migrants obviously and the border are very different up here in terms of scale and and and fenel as well right so its its try to work with the incoming administration on those issues to to buy some time or get a reprieve but be ready to hit back if you need to and and and the the sense we have from the canadian government is its not going to be dollar ford dooll retaliation because thats a trade war canada cant win you know and they would hit very specific uh strategic sectors of the american economy is that where its going in mexico or or do you think it could end up trying to go dollar for dollar dollar with the biggest economy on the planet yeah i think a lot will depend on what actual measures the united states announces and actually implements because theres been a lot of talk in washington about whether president trump will go ahead and uh apply tariffs across the board on all products traded uh with mexico and and canada which would be really extreme and it will amount essentially to suspending the usmca for whatever time those tariffs are in place uh what weve also been hearing is perhaps a more strategic approach that could involve yes imposing tariffs but in in certain sectors key sectors for export for mexico perhaps the same for canada and as the president said during his uh campaign you know the last days of the campaign he said that he would increase tariffs and continue increasing them until he gets results quote unquote and so uh thats another possibility and so based on whatever measures the united states takes i think the mexican government will will react obviously in retaliation its very hard to go tit fortat with the united states and most importantly whatever occurs in terms of retaliation and and and tariffs that the us may impose the strategy in the mexican government must be to try to make this as shortlived as possible so other words get to a to this constructive dialogue that the mexican government is talking about on immigration on security on china i think the mexican government through individual unilateral actions in mexico has already sent signals to the us you know with big captures of of shipments of a fenil for example with increasing tariffs on china other measures that are been taken on immigration the idea is to send the signal that mexico will be firm on not allowing uh you know the us a free pass so to speak if it violates the agreement but at the same time the willingness to address all of these important issues for north america what kind of signals is the mexican government and the mexican private sector getting in terms of how these these efforts are being received because i know theres been moves on on fenel you say and on migrants and some efforts to reduce the amount of chinese goods coming in including crackdowns on people on companies that sell them canadas done a bunch of things on the border were told its been well received by the people who will be part of the administration but nobody truly knows how donald trump feels about it whats the signal that mexico has received on its efforts and how those are being viewed exactly you said something thats very important how does the the the presidentelect actually see these things precisely because of the hierarchical way that he operates you know his his operatives his cabinet may think one thing but if if he hears something in the news or gets a certain perception from someone that may change completely the the policy of the us what we are hearing is that you know in both in the washington dc circle lets say uh you know in think tanks media people that are close to the to to the government and to the to the transition team these signals have seen as positive you know we we are starting from a lets say frankly a very low point of cooper operation on security for example with the previous administration with the lopez orador administration and president shane bound has taken strong actions against cartels already uh like i said intercepting shipments of of drugs sending her equivalent of a drug sar to spend time substantive substantial amount of time in the state of caloa where theres a lot of cartel activity so i think those those things are being received positively in the us also what mexico will try is trying to do and will try to do on immigration and on china but it remains to be seen once president trump comes into power and of course once his government apparatus is in place and the officials that will be in charge of the actual daytoday negotiating with mexico what what are the positions that they they will be taken but i think its a positive step uh on the international side that president shane bam is sending these signals and domestically the private sector is happy also because uh or at least satisfied with what has been announced this week with is a major uh economic growth program for the administration of cl shenan called the mexico plan and this is directly linked to how mexico will try to portray itself as a strong and important ally of the united states on the economic front as well are you worried though that donald trump looks at what mexico has done and looks at what canada has done hes never h without him even having imposed a single tariff or taken the oath of office hes gotten all of this movement and he said jump and everybody jumped that it incentivizes him to further drastic threats and even bigger demands for change because you reward the bully you get bullied some more it seems thats a very good point and its a very fine line you know you cant sort of break the dialogue or or or try to walk away from what will be a very substantive and important discussion with with a trump administration at the same time if you give too many concessions right up front i mean i know for a fact because i lived it when we negotiated the usmca he will just double down and keep asking more and more and more so that is the fine line and and and and sort of the equalizing effect that mexico has to find the right uh the right mix of willingness to sit down and to work constructively but at the same time stand your ground you know and and and draw very clear uh red lines on certain issues and i think thats why its very important that president shamam sent the signal that if theres a violation of the usmca mexico has to retaliate and to generate economic impact in the united states because thats what helped us back in the also with canada when the us raised tariffs on steel and aluminum within three weeks mexico had implemented uh retaliation and within the discussions on the usmca mexico and canada were excluded from national security measures in the automotive sector so thats an example that you have to sort of stand up to the big guy and say you know we are are are willing to negotiate but we will also o stand firm on our principles i wonder if i can squeeze in one more question with you because it you were part of a trade negotiation last time this isnt a trade negotiation as much as its like a trade war you know what i mean like at least the threat of a potential trade war so does that does that change your approach because in a negotiation youre exchanging positions and i get a clear sense of objectives and theres clarity and data going back and forth and sort of a bottom line takes hold i would presume in the conversation do you have to approach something like this completely differently than a standard trade renegotiation or negotiation deal well i dont think uh you have to address it radically differently that there are different conditions than what we faced in usmca in obviously this mixing up that trump is doing on on tariffs threats with immigration and security but lets remember that in and there was this constant threat by president trump that he was going to pull out of the of the nafta at the time which would have amounted to a major uh trade war or or cancellation of this very important economic growth mechanism for for mexico so we were under severe threat back then there was a talk of paying for the border wall etc so there are parallels to what we lived through uh in in the usmca negotiation and i think that mexico needs to try to separate it will be different difficult with trump but try to separate the discussion the immediate discussion on diffusing the threat tariff uh and and uh dealing with immigration and security and then after that really getting into the details as to what we want to obtain in the usmca review in because if you bunch everything up together i agree with you it gets very complicated to obtain solid economic results if youre also having to deal with fenton nil with immigration etc in the same negotiating table kenneth smith ramos always appreciate the time thank you for being here today sir and uh were gonna have an interesting week next week talk to you soon thank you very much david its a pleasure for

MkwlUtmSA18,has elon musk influenced the uk government over grooming gang inquiries bbc newscast,the government has shifted its position on whether there should be new inquiries in the uk into child grooming gangs on todays episode of newscast the bbcs daily news podcast we will ask whether elon musk the billionaire owner of the social network x is responsible for it hello its adam in the newscast studio and shortly ill be joined by bbc legend leis duet as we get the latest on the ceasefire deal between israel and hamas over the war in gaza and the implementation of that deal is maybe not going quite as smoothly as some people suggested sounds like theres a few sticking points and also there has still been further military action by israel in gaza because even the ceasefire once is agreed does not kick in until sunday but first of all were going to talk about why the home secretary evette cooper was saying this in the house of commons today as she announced a raft of new measures and investigations into child grooming gangs in the uk okay but in order to go much further i have asked baroness lise casey to oversee a rapid audit of the current scale and nature of gang based exploitation across the country and to make recommendations on the further work that is needed the specific ia report char se uh independent inquiry report on gang exploitation concluded that an accurate picture of the prevalence of child sexual exploitation could not be gleaned from the data and evidence that it had available so this audit will seek to fill that gap so its an audit not an inquiry and theres national support for local inquiries so theres quite a lot to get our head round but luckily one of the bbcs experts was watching evette coopers statement and shes here now its the bbcs social affairs editor allison holtz hello allison hello and henry zman is not at westminster hes here in the studio hello hi pleasure to be here henry when did you get the sense that actually something was a foot in terms of what the home office was doing uh a few hours before iet coopers statement was when i had a sense that iet cooper was going to do something today but over the last few days and look to be clear im not claiming that i would have predicted this today because i wouldnt have but over the past few days labor mps i speak to regularly who just last week were adamant that there should be no concession on this issue not on some of the emotions and the issues around the issue but but on the specific issue of a new inquiry of some sort they just started to soften that position in the past few days i think a lot of mps spent time with constituents over the weekend and discovered that while it not the top issue in many of their constituencies it is something that some of their uh actual voters people who back the labor party are concerned about and asking them for more action on and you just sort of started to sense the political ss shifting a bit right allison um youve got your notepad there and you were saying that there things you wrote down from what well that ive managed to count there may may more than but there key things i mean what are the key things within those where should we start so lets start with the government saying that its going to set out a clear timetable for taking forward the recommendation from from the final report of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse a real mouthful and they want to do that before easter uh they also want to implement recommendations from a standalone report into grooming that the inquiry did there will be five local inquiries looking into grooming gangs including in alder and what theyre going to try and do there is set up a framework which they say should be victim le and locally driven but it will be backed by government oh so what does that mean backed by government well i theyre theyre going to put tom crow the casey who led the inquiry the local inquiry in tford in that happened into grooming he is going to have oversight on these and be there to support them and i think the idea is that they come up with some sort of framework which works that gets the ansers um for victims and survivors of abuse it also allows for people to be held accountable there are lots of things we dont know about it i mean will people be compelled to give evidence but um yeah what power as all these local inquiries have um and and henry thats is that different or the same or halfway between a national inquire and a local inquiry a series of local inquiries that are backed at a national level well and a lot of the debate about whether there should be a new inquiry has hinged upon the fact that actually an inquiry has a very specific meaning in the uk there is such a thing as a statutory inquiry which has certain powers underpinned by law to compel witnesses to appear and weve seen all sorts of national inquiries you know there are several going on at the moment and they take time people involved get lawyers the inquiries have council uh and one of the arguments that people in government were putting forth last week against a new national inquiry is just hang on it would take so much time when actually what so many of the victims they speak to say they want is urgent action not more delay before more recommendations that then take some time to be implemented i think the risk for the government is that in trying to win the argument and make their case about speed they may end up in a position where they lose the confidence of some of the people whove been pushing for another inquiry with a lowercase eye because of that inability potentially to compel witnesses though i think were still not actually clear what the final position is on whether it will be able to compel witnesses as we record now but we can hear a bit of the criticism that came of at coopers way from chris philp who is the shadow home secretary thousands of young girls often in their early teens were systematically raped by gangs of men predominantly of pakistani heritage those in positions of authority the police local councils the cps ignored them and in some cases even covered up these horrendous crimes because of absurd concerns about socalled cultural sensitivity days ago the prime minister compounded this by saying it was a farright bandwagon to raise these issues and call for proper inquiry let me say this it is not far right to stand up for rape victims and smearing those who raised this issue is exactly what led to the victims order order the shadow home secretary will be heard secretary smearing those who raised this is exactly what led to the victims being ignored and the crimes covered up in the first place and that last bit there of chris philps referring to kir star saying the people calling for an inquiry were allying themselves with the far right i mean people have pretty much accepted that was a bit of a misstep by kir starmer when he when he said that even kir starmer himself has walked back from from that line well i think his argument is that it was a misunderstanding uh more than it was a misstep uh i mean look if youre the prime minister and people are misunderstanding what you say then uh thats a comms problem anyway but but he he says he never said that it was a far right issue but that some people who should have known better were jumping onto a bandwagon which some people on the far right were involved with so yeah a bit hard to to sort of explain and that maybe was part of his problem um i mean this is a change of position from the government i think we should be quite clear about that uh this was not what was being suggested privately but also publicly by the prime minister when in that first speech he gave which was meant to be about the nhs uh the first monday back at the start of last week uh when he had uh prepared remarks for the inevitable questions about elon musk uh and while he absolutely expressed um deep concern about this issue and uh talked about his record combating it as direct to public prosecutions there was no suggestion then that the government was going to end up um doing something different coordinating these local inquiries i mean they did always say that they would back local inquiries but the sort of nationally mandated local inquir with this extra national rapid review laid on top with louise casey is clear that theyve moved on this and by the way you know i know its not the focus today we should not lose sight of the fact there is no chance if at cooper would have been standing up in the house of commons saying this today if elon musk hadnt taken an issue an interest in it at some point over the christmas period and that remains uh an extraordinary an unusual fact that i just think we need to continue to reflect on because it could well be heralding i think a whole new way in which our information and political systems interact although the difficulty we have saying that um conclusively is that okay reform and the conservative party and gb news were campaigning on this and we dont know what would have happened if elon musk hadnt joined in like they or you do you think they wouldnt they together wouldnt have been able to get this over the line yeah im very confident in saying that and and theyve been campaigning on it to different degrees so i i think the like very original genesis of this bit of the story was um a scoop from gb news which was the letter that jess phillips in her capacity of safeguard so a story rather than a campaign i should say yeah but but that was then picked up by elon musk and and then reform shaw have been talking about this with different degrees of prominence for a while the conservative party havent been calling for a new national inquiry before uh i mean k bok acknowledged today uh when she was asked about this that you know she says well actually yeah maybe they should have done more in government so you they were in government quite recently i do think this debate has been moved on substantially even if its just catalyzing something that might have happened anyway i think theres an argument for that but im a bit skeptical i think elon musk has has has done that um and allison theres a bit that we havent talked about yet thats on your your list of things that cooper announced henrys alluded to it which is the actual national level thing which baroness lise casey is going to do what is what is that shes going to do a rapid audit of existing evidence around the scale of the problem of grooming gangs so she will pull together existing data but there is also one of the things theyve announced which uh is is very interesting is theyre going to try and gather much better data so from now on there will be a push to gather the information that can tell us who tend to form grooming gangs where are the areas is there a particular pattern or is it actually just at the moment question of where weve been looking so its information that can inform a wider debate i should also say you know ive been speaking to a lot of survivor groups in the in the the last week and theres this mix of frustration but also a recognition that this has put an important issue on the agenda in the last week its put it up the political agenda because what theyre saying is many of them are saying they want to see the recommendation of the independent inquiry where you know people gave evidence they want to see those recommendations brought in the feeling was that a lot of it had been pushed pushed into the long grass and the worry was will anything happen quickly enough well clearly weve got much more speed now its got attention but um they say that attention needs to be on what the views are of those whove experienced abuse what they say and the people who work with them say and so just to be clear what louise casey or baroness casey to give her her proper title is looking at is is going to look at the the race of people involved in these cases among other things shes going to get the information so one of the factors shell look at will be ethnicity and cultural drivers um it will also pull together information from police forces theyve been asked to look at their data um i should say about baroness louise casey she is a very busy woman well yes she is due to start in april her inquiry into the future of adult social care which is the other half of your job yeah exactly i spent a lot of time talking about that and i think that there will be a little bit of well certainly some raised eyebrows from the social care sector who were hoping that she would be spending the next few months engaging with them and looking at issues for instance over how quickly she will make her recommendations for future funding obviously shes now got another very big important job and do we know how baroness casey is going to do her multitasking henry i should say shes also in the last couple of weeks been appointed as the lead nonexecutive director in government which um might sound well no sorry does sound quite technical and boring but is another big role uh because every government department has a group of nonexecutive directors who are meant to oversee the work of the department and shes now in charge of all of them um which is a measure of the esteem in which shes held shes done she was a civil servant shes done uh various inquiries of different sorts um and is seen as sort of straight talking and uh straight to the point she did a brilliant series which is on bbc sounds uh maybe a year or so ago maybe a bit more than that about various sort of intractable problems in british uh public policy um but no i dont know how shes going to balance all of that other than that um clearly k people invest superhuman talents in her so im sure she has them i mean she is pretty superhuman when you meet her um i think what v cooper was saying is that that baroness casey will spend three months doing this rapid review and thats why its a rapid the emphasis being on rapid and then she starts and the social care review is long much to of some of the yeah shes got three years to finish that so i think i think thats how theyre theyre doing it um alison you mentioned the word accountability and this is where you realize how things are just getting a little bit complicated now people will be looking at these cases and im sure some people will will feel that maybe some counselors should be prosecuted for not doing their jobs properly and failing children is there anything in this package thats been announced today that might see a counselor prosecuted going to court being named and shamed for doing a bad job and failing children well that theyre talking about the plans that already exist for a duty of canada um and um i dont know the details of that uh exactly how it would work and how it would work in relation to this but i think one of the the um suggestions is that will lead to greater accountability and i think also scrutiny and the gathering of data will help with that accountability uh i also imagine that the framework that theyre putting forward for local inquiries is is meant to to help with that but weve still got so much information we need about how these things will work in practice and and just to end this bit of the conversation these locally led but nationally supported five inquiries we dont know all the areas all five yet but idea is that this provides a sort of template that then other local authorities if they kind of put their hand up and say we need some help to do this they can then take that template and there might be some central government money to help them well theyre describing them as pilots so the suggestion is that they will come up with some sort of framework which they could use in future possible inquiries now henry i noticed youve youve chosen your language carefully and you havent said uturn because a lot of people will be reaching for that cliche for to describe what the governments done today and you havent reached for it obviously thats because you would never use a cliche because youre a good good broad but um what how have you chosen the words youve used to describe it this is the media studies bit of this episode uh i i i actually dont think if we were to go in for the cliche i dont think its a full uturn because it is not a national statutary inquiry into grooming gangs um but i do think it is uh a significant change of position and uh it is far from the most important element of this very important story and this very harrowing issue but i think some labor mps will add this to the file that is growing by the day for some of them about k starma getting his initial political judgments about issues and where they are going a little bit of well yeah because this then gives ammo to people who want other decisions reversed like if youre really really angry about winter fuel payments being taken away from from all but the poorest pensioners you could then say well hang on you change your mind about inquiries about child sexual exploitation why is that worthy of a change of position and and and pensioners getting c isnt yeah thats thats why thats why changes of positions are are are can be corrosive for for leaders absolutely the counterargument is that uh knowing when to change a position is a sign of political strength rather than uh political intransigence but it its a fine balance and um as always with these things theres a risk of of the narrative kind of wagging the tail of the dog god that is talk about not clich to c been up since this morning and its pm but my point is the point i was trying to make and im now going to try to make more eloquently is when a prime minister is doing well often every decision they make gets uh shoehorned into the narrative that theyre doing well and when theyre doing badly and i think he his supporters would admit k st has had a rough period uh then everything becomes part of that narrative uh so you know we should be wary of that um and see how these uh local inquiries and the national review develop and whether they actually do the job that hes trying to do here which is staunch both the political saw and address what is a very real concern for lots of people not withstanding the fact that it was generated a bit in this iteration by elon musk and i should just say as were recording this episode at on thursday afternoon elon musk did tweet a little sorry post on x a little while ago he reposted the home office um post announcing this action plan and he then has put his own comment on it saying i hope this is a proper investigation now im going to make a massive hostage to fortune here talking about journalistic cliches that to me seems a much more kind of moderate response from elon musk than some of the stuff he was posting on x over the last couple of weeks so i wonder if actually that this is the this is the end of one chapter and the start of another which has got a kind of different tone to and come come monday hes going to be part of the us government so talk about is he part of the government because doge is sort of not its almost like being a lead nonexecutive director maybe him and are you comparing compare notes well baron casey does listen to newscasts shes pleased with that comparison she knows she knows to whatsapp us on henry thank you very much pleasure and allison thanks to you too thanks and now bbc chief international correspondent leis du is joining us in the newscast studio because we wanted to catch up with all the developments that have been since katar announced that israel and hamas had reached a ceasefire agreement made up of three different phases for the war in gaza that all happened on wednesday afternoon wednesday evening we did quite a big episode about it on wednesday night but there was still lots of unanswered questions about how the deal would actually be implemented and actually at what point israel would approve it the israeli cabinet would approve it so we can catch up with all of that now as we record this portion of newscast at about pm on thursday with leas hello so good to see you um adam busy week busy week yeah busy busy week um a week where we have to focus on very big momentous developments but also the little detail of of these uh this great sweep of history so its um its been a really really important fascinating time and with rare hope and happiness which is you know we dont often get to see when were covering the middle east and also the the israeli hostages havent been returned yet so those those reunions will be quite something to watch when they start happening in a couple of days i i was on a program yesterday with with a man named moshe whose brotherinlaw is one of the last they say theres left about um are said believed to be dead and you could feel his agony that it was of course happiness mixed with anxiety because the men uh the young men the male soldiers will not be released in the first phase of the deal and so if the pro breaks down after the first of the hostages the women the civilians the children are released it really it means that his cautious hope will will come to nothing so theyre not allowing themselves yet to to to be too hopeful because they have been let down so many times before how many times weve sat here before adam and said theyre done were closer than we ever before its there is a deal uh and we understand that the last minute snags have been have been now sorted it will go to the israeli security cabinet and the and the full cabinet tomorrow but theres a still a lot that could go wrong and we well well talk about the machinations in a second but i suppose also talking about the the emotional dimension we also see the site of gazin returning to their homes which dont really exist anymore and thats going to happen on a massive scale and of course that will be pictures that come to us from people in gaza because were still as journalists not allowed to go there i was listening to some palestinians from gaza speaking on the bbc just before i joined you adam and the same people whod been celebrating with joy in the streets were c were crying in the dark because after this explosion of of relief that finally that the war was going to end then the bombardment started and more people were killed more houses were destroyed as israel says its targeting terrorists and civilians get in not get way the civilians are there as well and and are some more than have been killed since the announcement that there was a deal so it again it they they feel let down they feel that they dont they dont have the luxury of hoping until it is it is done it is done and yes when they to say theyre going to be able to go home most of them have no homes left it is just a pile of rubble so many palestinians who sought refuge in the south of the gaza they were forced to evacuate under israeli orders and many of whom and weve heard them on the bbc have moved as many were pushed as many as times from to they havent seen their mother they havent hugged their mother their father for the last months so and its millions and millions of people well theres more you know more than more than a million yes and um bittersweet bittersweet and of course this is really a deal where its going to be lived day by day in a roller coaster of emotion it is a very long road to the a different future for israelis and palestinians it has huge not just rocks on the road but huge boulders and diversions but the most important thing adam is that at long last they are embarking on this road and the first stretches the first tarmac seems to be quite smooth that first weeks could go could go well except you were hinting at some issues with with actually signing the deal in israel whats yes so we were expecting today and you may have discussed it yesterday on the program that once the announcement was made in qatar by qatars prime minister whos also the foreign minister whos played a very key role in the mediation along with um senior egyptians and senior americans he announced the deal but you know perhaps in less less loud voices yeah theres a few little details that have to be sorted out we got conflicting reports all through today this and which led to the cabinet meeting the meeting of the two the cabinets for final approval on the israeli side to be to be held israel immediately blamed hamas and said that hamas was trying to put new prisoners names on the list at the th hour trying to sneak some in even though the list had already been agreed just before i joined you theres a report in arab media that said that prime minister netanyahu the israeli side also tried to put names on the list we dont have the full story yet perhaps its in the nature of the beast in terms of these highly complex and deeply politicized very emotional peace proc processes i cant call it a peace process a ceasefire and a and a hostage release that there are things that can go wrong at the very last minute that people will try to seees advantage can have a wobble have final thoughts then of course weve seen some of the you know the military activity is continuing but all lies now are on midday sunday adam where the first of the hostages theres been reports it could be three could be five female israeli soldiers there were talks before could be the children uh theres great anticipation of that because it was said that some of the children were dead so it will be a very emotional day um and just in terms of israeli politics im not clear just how much netanyahu relies on his very rightwing allies to stay in power because you hear some people saying oh theres two people from the from the far right who could torpedo this whole thing in israel and th basically have him thrown out of office but then other people saying no hes managed to broaden his not necessarily his his his government but his his base of support that means hes not so reliant on them anymore what whats your say yes mr sm the finance minister and also the itar ben gavier who um is the national security minister uh both of them have been very public uh denouncing this agreement its catastrophic all the way through this process theyve been adamant that this war must continue until hamas is destroyed as as which is what prime minister netanyahu has said in fact itamar benir in the last two days has basically come out and boasted that he has stopped uh a deal from being done many times before um and we are we do understand president biden has said the deal thats basically been signed was the one that was put on the table in may but it has had many many many uh obstacles on the way including from hamas which had its own red lines what we understand adam is that while they are vowing to stop the deal they cannot there is a majority a big enough majority in the c security cabinet and the broader cabinet to for this to go through we dont know whether they will carry out their threat to bring down the government it was always said um and this is constantly in israeli media that prime minister netan does not want to bring down his government he doesnt want to end the war because there will be a reckoning and he will have to answer questions about this huge intelligence failure which allowed this atrocious hamas attacks to actually take place on october the th in but there is there is there has been some discussion that they may be persuaded to stay on because they realize that this new administration the trump administration has a has a team which talks in the language that they do they dont talk for example the new the man whos to become mike hakabe who is nominated to be the new us ambassador to israel he says i dont talk about the west bank he uses the biblical name judea and samaria he also would be uh amendable to the annexation of the west bank and there are other members of president trumps team who think the same and so there may be an administration that the far right will not have difficulties with although i think that they theres also been some discussion about how they didnt expect kind of pressure theyre now thinking oh president trumps team or presidentelect trumps team is pushing us into this deal and we thought they would not so and i i think prime minister netan is very aware he got used to dealing with president biden and was able to duck and dive uh president trump is different uh he basically says do it and if you dont theres consequences theres hell to pay as he said it to hamas but it also applies to to israel so we dont think they can stop the we will see they may wait to the second phase to see and there is discussion what is what is prime minister netan saying to them behind closed doors lets lets get started we can restart the war later there is a theres a ghetto clause if you like what the qatari the americans uh the egyptian mediators what certainly the arab leaders what palestinians will hope and many israelis will hope therell be enough pressure once there will be a momentum once the process starts to keep this going and as weve seen in the middle east and we didnt have to be reminded a day is a long time in this conflict its been the past months have been to use the word that defines as unprecedented in every way and im just thinking whats interesting about the timing is that that after we recorded newscast last night about kind of issue k time wed seen bidens statement flanked by kamla harris and and anthony blinkin the secretary of state then a few hours later he was in the oval office doing his sort of goodbye address people but actually in news terms his goodbye address to the world was his statement about gaza thats the thats thats the full stop to his presidency he we people didnt pay as much attention to his own version of his own record like this and he also he spent most of it warning about the dangers to democracy that there were these oligarchs that who were taking home you know people small group of men with a lot of power and money were taking over so was that also was quite unusual that usually that is a moment for them to reflect on their successes but he had sounded a lot of rang a lot of bells warning bells about which he did throughout his election campaign when he was until he pulled out of the election campaign and and even before the campaign had warned about the threats to democracy about the threats to the united states um but its were almost its almost there its almost the th so its not a coincidence that this deal is supposed to start the th so trump is now saying hey im not even president and look what im able to do that also was unprecedented the two administrations not just working together sitting at the same table its never happened before well at least thanks for sitting at our table today yes i think if we sit here too long something else might happen adam so we better we better hand our conversation get back to your phone ill get back to my laptop thank you very much and thats all for this episode of newscast thank you to everyone whos been on it and thanks to you too for listening well be back with another one very soon byebye
YAiH8IMHnuU,thailands opposition parties dominate in challenge to armybacked government abc news,in a room full of journalists and about a hundred cameras peter limjer and rat did what no one thought possible a few years ago or even a few weeks ago he declared victory for his young progressive party move forward it ran with a risky agenda in conservative thailand of vowing to end military conscription and monopolies and amend the law which makes criticizing the powerful monarchy a crime but with huge gains including an almost clean sweep of seats in bangkok mr peter said it was clear thai voters were ready for change today is a new day and hopefully its full of bright sunshine of hope going forward thai politics is complicated though and winning the most seats is only the start of the battle the main opposition party poor thai led by patongtan shinowat the daughter of divisive former pm taxin came in at close second mr peter says hes asked miss patongtan as well as five smaller parties to join a coalition with him and while hes declared victory and said hell be the prime minister the vote for pm in thailand is something entirely removed from the election the person is chosen by the elected members of the lower house and the members of the militaryappointed senate so even though voters delivered a resounding rejection of military at the ballot box the military can still maneuver its way into deciding who forms the next government and if it does theres already talk that ties will take out their anger on the streets

want to answer that let me ask another question for comments just like this that are and i will work with you i will work with you senator i will work with all of you in this country for everything that senator blackburn said we have got to reduce violent crime and we have got to restore integrity to our law enforcement officers donald trump we keep saying he won this election by million votes and electoral votes look at the map of california senator shiff its bright red the popular vote for a reason people want law and order they want to be safe so they can go to take their children to school so they can go to church senator holly people want safe streets of course we care about our economy and whats happening in this world but if were not safe none of that works we have got to come together we have got to work together to make america safe again and that in turn will make america great again and i dont know where that phrase has become a bad word because i think thats a great one making america great again most americans believe that central to the peaceful transition of power in a democracy is the acceptance of the results of an election to my knowledge donald trump has never acknowledged the legal results of the election are you prepared to say today under oath without reservation that donald trump lost the presidential contest to joe biden in ranking member durban president biden is the president of the united states he was duly sworn in and he is the president of the united states there was a peaceful transition of power president trump left office and was overwhelmingly elected in do you have any doubts that joe biden had the majority of votes electoral votes necessary to be elected president in you know senator all i can tell you as a prosecutor is from my firsthand experience and i accept the results i accept of course that joe biden is president of the united states but what i can tell you is what i saw firsthand when i went to pennsylvania as an advocate for the campaign i was an advocate for the campaign and i was on the ground in pennsylvania and i saw many things there but do i accept the results of course i do do i agree with what happened and and i saw so much you know not no one from either side of the aisle should want there to be any issues with election integrity in our country i think that question deserved a yes or no and i think the length of your answer is an indication that you werent prepared to answer yes do you believe that the january riers whove been convicted of violent assaults on police officers should be pardoned senator if confirmed as a attorney general of the united states the pardons of course fall under the president but if asked to look at those cases i will look at each case and advise on a case by case basis just as i did my entire career as a prosecutor it would not be appropriate for a prosecutor to start with a name and look for a crime its a prosec his job to start with a crime and look for a name correct senator i think that is the whole problem with the weaponization that we have seen the last four years and whats been happening to donald trump they targeted donald trump they went after him actually starting back in they targeted his campaign they have launched countless investigations against him that will not be the case if i am attorney general i will not politicize that office i will not target people simply because of their political affiliation justice will be administered evenhandedly throughout this country senator weve got to bring this country back together weve got to move forward or were going to lose our country yeah i think the concern is that weaponization of the justice department may well occur under your tenure and we want to make sure that thats not the case can you clarify for me that in following ethics and the law youd be willing to resign if ordered to do something improper senator i wouldnt work at a law firm i wouldnt be a prosecutor i wouldnt be attorney general if anyone asked me to do something improper and i felt i had to carry that out of of course i would not do that thats one of the main things you learn when youre a young prosecutor is to do the right thing and and i believe that has continued with me throughout my very long career thank you mr chairman thank you thank you senator applause music
iPbXzPBHdHk,rep presley commends biden for acting boldly with pardons commutations,michael when you have the power you have to use it and president biden has the power he and he alone has the power of clemency and he recognizes that it is a lifechanging transformative tool and so i commend him for acting boldly because there are so many systemic injustices uh resulting in a mass incarceration uh crisis the war on drugs uh policies uh which have contributed to that mass incarceration crisis and a broken clemency system which has thousands of people whose lives are in limbo so i i commend president biden for acting boldly this most recent action these uh individuals who will be reunited uh with their families um its life changing
EplmcsyEoDg,fallout from trumps gaetz pick elon musks growing political influence more america decides,music im calling on the house ethics committee to preserve and share their report and all relevant documentation on mr gates with the senate judiciary committee matt gates has chosen to resign from the house but he cant choose to conceal that information i think there should not be any limitation on the senate judiciary committees investigation the real question is going to be does does the senate that has the responsibility for the confirmation have the same level of conf hello im nancy cordes in washington welcome to america decides tonight transition drama what allies had been calling a smoother trump transition runs into a rough patch with even republicans openly musing about whether some of the presidents cabinet picks stand a chance of being confirmed late today presidentelect donald trump said he would nominate robert f kennedy jr to lead the department of health and human services the choice of kennedy an antivaccine activist is expected to cause major alarm among health officials and experts robert f kennedy cares more about human beings and health and the environment than anybody im going to let him go wild on health im going to let him go wild on the food im going to let him go wild on medicines this announcement comes on the heels of for former florida congressman matt gates being tapped for attorney general and our major garrett and scott mcfarland are following all of this and are here to help us break it all down major so good to see you there was no doubt that robert f kennedy jr was going to have some kind of role in the trump administration but there was an assumption that perhaps hed hold some kind of zar position because he would be difficult to get confirmed but no the presidentelect went all the way naming him the head of hhs whats the thinking here i think within this evolving trump transition robert f kennedy jr represents the strongest push back against all the things that happened during the pandemic whether it was vaccine mandates mask mandates public health experts making all sorts of decisions affecting commerce affecting what is viewable on the internet robert f kennedy jr is sort of a reaction against all of that i had a long interview with him in nashville in july right after president biden stepped down and he said there was massive censorship massive constitutional violations all carried out under the guise of pandemic protections that message caught hold with trump supporters and this slogan make america healthy again opposition to the fda opposition to the cdc opposition to any regulatory agency that robert f kenedy jr argues passionately some would argue erroneously but he still argues passionately are basically in the hands of those who were there supposed to regulate big pharma big a to the detriment of average american citizens that took hold in maga world and its part of the reason hes nominated today and just to outline why this is such an unorthodox choice uh he doesnt have a medical background but thats not a deal breaker our current hhs secretary does not have a medical background but he has spread conspiracy theories about vaccines he has spread conspiracy theories about covid and then when asked about that by you and others he said no i dont denies it and the record is very clear on this and if there is a confirmation hearing all of that will be aired he says hes not antia but he also says that thimerosol which is a preservative in some vaccines causes autism the scientific data on that is absolutely clear by the way therasol was never used in mmr vaccines chickenpox or polio the ones given to children so they were never in the children vaccine conversation ever yet to this day robert f kennedy jr wi as will say no they cause autism which is a huge scare tactic and creates genuine fear among those who dont know the underlying science that is a legitimate area of inquiry for robert real life implications because we see that when kids dont get v inated there are measles outbreaks uh and there disruptions to their health and there are disruptions to the schools in which they attend scott i know uh that this announcement just happened so it its its relatively early but this is the world we now live in are you hearing concerns yet up there on capitol hill about this choice from lawmakers weve got limited reaction as this news happened as senators are on planes headed home from washington dc so far its a long party lines bill cassidy the republican from louisiana a doctor by the way who has oversight on health issues uh applauded the selection of robert f kennedy jr and we have the democrat ron widen from oregon who said just the opposite so at this point its a predictable fallout from the nomination lets see if somebody goes counter to their party on this particular choice but whats more striking to me nancy is how just the past hours have crystallized themselves as the first real showdown of a president elect and his own partys controlled senate you can just see it coming you can see the writing on the walls and you can hear the names echoing off the marble on the walls matt gates rfk jr they have consumed the attention and the conversation in washington dc and whats being asked of these senators is not just do you support these nominees but do you think youre going to have a normal process to confirm them matt gates confirm in the traditional system as attorney general and if not does that mean the senates going to unilaterally disarm some of its power this is make no mistake the first showdown between the two and its unclear after the first hours nancy which side is winning scott there uh there are obviously questions about whether matt gates uh who as you mentioned is the presidents pick to be the nations top law enforcement official uh the um the the secretary of um the im sorry the attorney general rather to head up the doj um there are questions about whether he can get confirmed but setting that aside now that he has resigned his position in the house what are you hearing will happen to this house ethics investigation that was just wrapping up and was um depending on how the ethics committee voted potentially about to be released that house ethics committee investigation nancy began in april this is a comprehensive thing and we know from what weve been told and what the committee has released out this is an investigation of allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use allegations former congressman gates has denied in totality throughout now that hes a former member of congress the custom is the house ethics committee drops the case they no longer have jurisdiction over a former congressman and that is been custom for many years but the senate democrats want to copy of that report in fact the chair of the senate judiciary committee made a formal ask that they release to the senate the findings of that investigation any number of other senate democrats have said theyre calling on it or demanding it too its unclear if it happens or when it happens theres always the possibility what was found in that investigation leaks out somehow but you know as well as anybody the house ethics committee is perhaps the most leak proof ship sailing in these waters um these are questions that are going to remain out there and there have been a few members of congress whove gotten our ear today and said if they dont release an ethics committee investigation which is possibly damning is that something that can be leveraged against a matt gates once hes the attorney general in a way that shouldnt be leveraged does this need to get out there for his own good too its democrats asking that question rhetorically but its being asked nonetheless and whats interesting is that there are even some republicans like john corin of texas who are saying hey if im going to make a decision on this guy i want to um what that ethics investigation looks like the bigger question that i have for you though major is um you know youve got republicans who are major allies of president trump expressing reservations about multiple cabinet picks hows that going over at mara lago not well and i think we should all brace ourselves for this potential scenario which is the president saying i want the senate and the house to recess for a certain period of time and while youre in recess i will appoint these cabinet members and they will take positions for two years and the senate will have no advice and consent role whatsoever the senate would have to agree to that but trump has basically created so many difficult confirmation battles that some senate republicans might say i just i dont i dont want to take a hard vote i dont want to ask hard questions i dont want to anger the maga movement i dont want to anger president trump i dont want to take any of those political risks ill just for the moment hand over these institutional powers mark my words you hand over those institutional powers once youve handed them over youre not getting forever you have handed them over forever i was talking to peter welch senator from vermont democrat today for my show the takeout he served in the house for a long time he understands the house ethics committee institutionally would want to protect this report and not give it to the senate except in a circumstance where there is a live question about someone who could be the attorney general and whether or not that person violated ethics or possibly laws he said that report should be released the senate should have it in full right and there are a lot of senate republicans who might be willing to go along with that the question is are virtually all of them willing to go along with it because youd need a majority of the senate to approve that major garrett scott mcfarland thank you both so much appreciate you we are continuing to follow the breaking news that presidentelect donald trump has offered rfk jr the health and human services secretary role more on the beliefs he could potentially bring to a trump administration next youre watching america decides stick music around we are continuing to follow the breaking news this evening that presidentelect trump has selected robert f kennedy jr as secretary of health and human services kennedy faced several controversies during his own white house bid including this conspiracy theory about covid covid is targeted to attack uh caucasians and and uh and uh black people the people who are most immune are asaj jews and uh and chinese lets bring in claire malone for analysis she has covered rfk jr for the new yorker wrote an extensive deep dive on a lot of his beliefs claire malone thank you so much for being with us uh take us through the evolution if you will uh from rfk jr the environmental hero and activist lawyer to the rfk jr of today who has espoused support for raw milk and railed against seed oils a and has argued erroneously that vaccines are dangerous to children yeah um kennedy was uh seen as someone with real clout in the new york city environmental scene super kind of you know against the man very skeptical of corporations and did a lot of litigation work against genuine corporate polluters particularly of the hudson river which at one point was very very polluted and so he does have these bonafides in the environmental movement and in the early s he started verging into this vaccine skepticism that really took hold and i think was of exacerbated by his corporate skepticism i mean if you listen or if you went to his events during the campaign he actually was sort of clever not to mention his antivaccine views all that much but he talked a ton about corporate capture and about how americans are being poisoned by corporations and i think its you know his movement from respected member of a democratic family and obviously we cannot undersell the fact that you know kennedy got to his place of prominent very much through the kennedy name i though he is also i think a very um hes sort of a charismatic presence in many ways a person who was able to move through new york society and raise money for his causes but he he sort of um went to this this place of the the maha movement you know make america healthy again in a way that a lot of americans i think in the past four or five years have kind of glommed on to that covid vaccines made them skeptic skeptical and that skepticism sort of turned their head everywhere and sort of made them say well whats happening in my food and medicine and water and i think you know hes he is this very interesting encapsulation of amer some americans kneejerk reaction to the pandemic um obviously packaged in you know a kennedy uh a kennedy name um so hes a hes quite an interesting figure and i think one of the important things to note about him is that he has taken positions that a lot of health experts do agree with hes talked about um the danger of processed foods and wanting to make sure that kids eat healthier meals at school uh at the same time he has uh said that he wants to have every nutritional scientist across hhs and the department of agriculture fired on day one so has a very ambitious agenda that has left some health experts in this country pretty worried yeah i i mean i think its um you know its too early for me to speculate about you know um what he might do on day one although the the rhetoric is obviously there from the campaign one thing i think we do know about kennedy though is that he has long for a long time even as others were sort of you know kind of calling him a a tinfoil hat conspiracist he has really taken himself seriously he really believed that he could and should be president of the united states and i do think he has this vocational aspirational sense of mission which you know some of it is egotism as it is with all politicians but i do think he has a real sense that he wants to be um a change maker um and i you know i think with all these trump appointments and kennedy of course its really you know i think his appointment is probably send a lot of shock ways through not just the federal bureaucracy but also you know state health departments who will have to think about well how do we potentially pick up slack from you know um places where the federal government might be pulling away support so i think you know hes hes probably got an ambitious um vision for all of this right and he didnt always have political ambitions in fact you wrote in your amazing article about the fact that what really triggered his interest in running in the first place was the fact that his uh his antivaccine organizations social media accounts got shut down by facebook and instagram uh because he was spreading misinformation and he told you well i started thinking the one place they cant censor me is if i run for president and it now seems like that was a gamble that could pay off correct yes he uh he he said that free speech was a huge motivating factor during his campaign and i also feel uh the need to note you know theres also been a lot of good reporting about um how much kennedy personally benefited from um being in the vaccine skepticism um sort of general area um hes its its sort of been personally lucrative for him to sort of be in this spotlight um so uh yes its um its a its an interesting position he finds himself in now thats thats for sure yep and lots of twists and turns to come as we watch to see whether he can actually be confirmed by the senate once presidentelect trump takes office cla malone uh thank you so much for being with me i appreciate it thanks for having me only a handful of republicans who voted to impeach donald trump will be back next year what that says about the president elect grip on the republican party thats coming up youre watching america decides music welcome back to america decides house republicans voted to impeach donald trump after january just a few years later only two of them are left in congress congressman david valo of california and dan new house of washington state both won reelection last week the other eight lawmakers either lost in or decided not to run cbs news political ical reporter hunter woodall joins us now to discuss so they are an endangered species hunter what accounts for the survival of these two members its fascinating nancy because its a unique primary system that really has benefited both congressman valo and congressman new house washington state and california where theyre both from have a nonpartisan top two primary systems theyve been able to advance to the general election building some of that coalition that shows you know why they were able to appeal to both maybe moderates conservatives and maybe even democrats now for dan new house he actually defeated a trump endorsed republican in this general election it was a republican versus republican contest david valo has isnt a battleground district he has won close races before he is projected to have won one again in this election lets talk about the senate then for a second because there were seven senate republicans who voted to convict donald trump uh back in three of them are still in the senate thats correct and it was interesting you know i was i was on capitol hill this week i was talking to senators talking to house members and there were so many questions to these three senators about well are you going to you know how are you going to vote if you know ark jr gets picked for cabinet slot you know and all this stuff and the idea was you know theyre seen as the potential resistance to trump within the gop thats maybe not a role that they necessarily want to be in but in the narrow majority like this that senate republicans are expected to have here thats that can be tough and thatll be a challenge for president elect trump right and well see where theyre willing to break with him and where they arent hunter woodall thanks so much fascinating earlier today federal reserve chair jerome powell touted what he called a quote remarkably good economy he spoke to business leaders business leaders in dallas and went on to say that the central bank could take its time cutting interest rates powell did not give a timeline for when we could potentially see those cuts presidentelect trump who has been critical of powell has argued that he should have say over interest rate policy could the man who the justice department once investigated for sex trafficking soon lead the doj well take a closer look into former congressman matt gatess past and why his pick is sending shock waves through washington youre watching america decides well be right music back welcome back to america decides former congressman matt gates was once investigated by the very department he now hopes to lead the justice department looked into sex trafficking allegations against gates for years it decided not to charge gates and closed the probe last year the house ethics committee though has been investigating claims of sexual misconduct and other violations uh against gates before he resigned yesterday he has denied wrongdoing we should note cbs news investigative producer michael kaplan joins us now michael you have been uh investigating these investigations for years what do we know about what could be in this house ethics report and will it ever see the light of day well nancy we know it could be quite damaging uh in june the committee underlined some of the allegations uh it was reviewing including sexual misconduct elicit drug use financial impropriety and its really those really those sexual misconduct claims that could prove to be the most explosive we know at least four women have come and testified in front of the committee telling them they were paid to attend parties with drugs and sex uh where rep gates was also uh present and we know that one of those women has said uh that she had sex with gates when she was just years old um her attorney said in a statement today she was a quote high school student and there were witnesses um so that just gives you a sense of some of the details that could could come out in this report gates has previously denied all wrongdoing and you know has called the committees investigation a frivolous smear campaign but uh he must uh its no surprise he might be feeling relieved that this report may never see the light of day right because now that hes resigned theres a chance good chance that the house ethics committee could just drop the whole thing um michael can you explain why the justice department looked into some of these allegations as well inves investigating sex trafficking in particular but then dropped those allegations yeah well doj had investigated gates as part of a larger sex trafficking probe that they opened back in and this was when uh president trump was still president um you know in fact as we learned weve since learned uh gates had asked trump for a blanket pardon ahead of ahead of trump leaving office uh because this investigation was coming down the pike you know while the justice department brought charges against some of gates associates some of whom are in prison now uh no charges were ever brought against gates himself um so uh you know we this this was going to be a document where some of those details in the investigation in the doj investigation were ultimately laid out in some sort of official document you know there are some senators who say they deserve to see whatever is in this ethics committee report obviously the public has an interest in knowing about the allegations against this person who could be the nations top law enforcement official how does it work uh with the ethics committee when someone who they are investigating ends up resigning for from congress as or leaving in some other way um as we just saw gates do yesterday when he said now that he has been picked to uh be ag hes resigning from congress well pre previously theyve shut down their investigation because the member is no longer in congress um obviously this is a a sort of unprecedented situation and people uh close to the committee who ive spoken with say its hard to imagine that this this document or the details in this document never see the never sees the light of day as you mentioned democratic senators are uh are asking for not only the report but the underlying information ahead of uh what is expected to be a pretty contentious confirmation hearing um and but the committee itself is sort of not commenting on its investigation or on uh whether theyll ultimately release these findings yeah damaging information has a way of uh getting out on capitol hill one way or the other michael kaplan investigative reporter for cbs news thanks so much thank you nancy and to discuss this further lets bring in our political panel kevin sheridan and mandere jones kevin served as a spokesperson for the republican national committee he was also a senior adviser for the romney ryan presidential campaign mandere previously served in congress as a democrat for new yorks th district gentlemen welcome to both of you mere you served alongside congressman gates and um uh i imagine that there are a lot of your former colleagues who would really like to see that house ethics report because gates is not exactly the most popular now former member of the house um not just when it comes to democrats but when it comes to a lot of republicans as well yeah i started on the house judiciary committee uh with gates got to know him a little bit on that on that committee uh but perhaps more relevant for this discussion i also served on the house ethics committee and i know about the important work that this body does uh it is evenly divided five republicans five democrats the staff uh are incredible and the work that they do is confidential and until its not until they vote to release uh the work product and while i dont think that mike johnson is going to allow his republican members on that committee to issue the report uh i think theyre going to be meeting tomorrow morning to have a vote on this very topic it remains to be seen whether the report will be leaked anyway i mean it is of great national importance uh it is certainly probative of it is relevant to uh whether this man is qualified from an ethical standpoint uh to serve as attorney general of the united states u i think it is also widely understood that he is not qualified from a legal standpoint i mean this is someone who only practiced law for a couple of years has never been a prosecutor and who has been credibly accused used of sex trafficking as you noted earlier and he has few friends on the right on capitol hill kevin because even though he is a fierce defender of donald trump he also led the charge to push kevin mccarthy out of the speakership last year which is something that most republicans didnt want yeah now hes got to go back in front of um a legislative body not the same one but the senate and and somehow get um you know get confirmation from senators who have lots of friends in the house im sure uh and theyre not going to uh you know this will not be an easy confirmation i dont think i i i will say though that a lot of these senators right now are not looking to uh oppose donald trump on anything but if it becomes so obvious that uh you know if some of this stuff actually comes out and uh it looks really bad maybe that that flips uh just enough or he pulls out look if he goes in front of that uh committee though and testifies hes a bomb thrower and that will be a remarkable television i think it will be musty tv you know there are all these different theories out there about why donald trump would name someone like matt gates in the first place who is under investigation for um some pretty um uh pretty seedy behavior to put it mildly theres one theory that perhaps uh trump wants to push him through via recess appointment have him go wild in trumps vernacular within the department of justice fire a bunch of career attorneys and then have him leave and bring in someone else theres another theory that uh says well hes nominating gates because he makes other nominees look more palatable which theory do you adhere to i im sticking with the theory that this is who donald trump actually wants i actually think that he wants somebody hes been tortured by the doj in his mind uh for the last four years and i think he wants somebody whos the biggest middle finger he can send into that building and uh and i i honestly believe thats what it is if if he makes it through confirmation another person that trump appears to really want is rfk jr to be secretary of health and human services whats your reaction to that pick look it you wonder whether thats worse than or or better than matt gates being the attorney general of the united states i mean these are historically bad nominations that have been made in the past to hours toy gabber had this other not happened would have been the worst nomination potentially in the history of american government to be the director of national intelligence uh shes a russian asset so so its really scary obviously um rfk as a as a denier of of of vaccine efficacy uh we are still sort of recovering from a covid environment here uh globally and certainly in the united states of america uh he has wild conspiracy theories that have been debunked very easily and and you dont want someone like that over scientific research of great national and global importance uh the hhs is a huge its a huge department i mean it has a massive budget it oversees medicare uh the cdc all kinds of really important things that impact our daily lives our health and our safety and you dont want a guy like that in charge of that interestingly one democrat who disagrees with you is colorado governor jared polus who just uh posted a short time ago that hes excited by the news that the presidentelect will appoint robert f kennedy jr to hhs he helped us defeat vaccine mandates i hope he leans into personal choice on vaccines rather than bans what do you make of that yeah so when i i saw that tweet i didnt believe it was from jared i mean i went to the the page i still didnt believe it and and i dismissed it until other people journalists in particular started amplifying it and and characterizing it im sted by that analysis especially because a few months ago the governor of colorado criticized rfk for wanting in his own words uh to facilitate measles a measles outbreak among other diseases kevin what are you hearing from republicans in the senate about this choice that theyre being forced to make not just about rfk jr but about matt gates about tulsey gabard uh pete heth these are all very unconventional nominees a lot lot of senate republicans want to give donald trump the leeway to name his candidates his um his cabinet but hes putting them in a tough position i think they think he clearly believes he has the mandate of the american people he ran on all this stuff and hes going to execute on it however if they start hearing from their constituents on any of these specific picks because theyve gone a little too far uh thats where youll get the uh the push back and it only needs to be three or four uh members of the senate who who could tank one of these but you know we just we have to get through the background checks we have to get through uh the interviews if theyre going to do interviews uh with each individual senator and and then even get to the hearings so uh weve got a long ways to go very quickly do you think thats the reason that john th won the race for a senate republican leader and not rick scott who trump wanted i i ive always thought john thun was going to uh to win that he was poised from going back for years working with mitch mcconnell and obviously hes a hes a different face to put on it now but uh yeah rick scott didnt have very very much support in the end yep well mandere jones uh thank you so much kevin sheridan really appreciate both of you coming in sharing your wisdom thanks so much when you see presidentelect trump these days you might see billionaire elon musk by his side up next the new report that takes a closer look at musks new role as in his words the quote first buddy youre watching america music decides presidentelect trump announced this week that elon musk will help lead a new agency known as the department of government efficiency the new york times has new reporting on the billionaires influence on the trump transition calling him uncle elon as some trump family members have now been known to do a new article says in part quote the worlds richest person has ascended to a position of extraordinary unofficial influence in mr trumps transition process playing a role that makes him indisputably americas most powerful private citizen theodore scher joins us now he is a campaign finance reporter for the new york times the author of that article teddy thank you so much for being here uh walk us through the timeline of how musk uh went from a time critic of donald trump to someone who is now firmly ensconced in his inner circle yeah it all happened rather quickly i mean even uh in the calendar year were really talking about here um you know elon musk and donald trump basically had no existing uh significant relationship before a couple months ago um unlike someone like howard lutnick or linda mcmahon who are the transition committee cochairs whove known trump for decades uh elon didnt really spend any time with him in person until actually what youre seeing right now on the screen where hes jumping up on uh on the um stage at the butler rally um you know elon musk wanted ronda sandz to be the republican nominee but beginning around this spring he and advisers started meeting to plot a super pack that became called america pack which elon musk would put upwards of billion million uh into it and now hes uh by trumps side at marago every day pretty good return on investment there was a uh one section of your article that really stood out to me i want to read it you said quote mr musk has assumed an almost mythical aura in mr trumps inner circle at maral lago

9YtXCDJGkoU,donald trumps inauguration moved indoors due to dangerous cold bbc news,lets turn straight to that breaking news just in the last few moments its being reported by the us media that donald trumps inauguration on monday is going to be moved indoors because of the dangerously cold temperatures expected on monday he is expected to be sworn in apparently inside the us capital retunda and the inauguration parade that we also see may potentially be held inside washingtons capital sport sports arena donald trumps transition team is being contacted lets go straight to washington straight for more on this breaking news n ikbal is there for us and nomia this is hugely unusual but uh terrible temperatures expected there for monday so a last minute switch of plans a very very last minute switch of plans yes just to repeat there donald trump has tweeted well put on his social media that uh this is an to keep uh people safe he says uh everyone will be happy and uh basically there is this uh arctic blast that is sweeping the country im just looking at the forecast now and it is braced to be dangerously cold on monday uh temperatures are predicted to not get much above degrees fahrenheit and then youre going to have like all the howling cold winds and it so it will very much feel like in the single digits uh yes it is very unusual the last time that this happened when the inauguration was moved inside was ronald reagans in donald trump does mention that uh in his uh social media post uh so exactly you know you know itll be obviously uh hugely stressful i imagine for organizers to to get on top of that but uh yes donald trump has confirmed that the inauguration will take place uh indoors on monday i was reading only the last couple of days because increasing theres been a lot of attention about this inauguration as the temperatures drop and looking at the history books it was william harrison of course back in the shest presidency because he died a month after the inauguration with a very similar thing freezing temperatures he stood there for a couple of hours without a coat without a hat and then caught pneumonia so that is what the history books tell us in terms of donald trump he has apparently been talking on social media saying hes ordered the inauguration address to be delivered inside the capital retunda but also saying i will join the crowds at capital one after my swearing in you touched on it though i mean in terms of the organization it is a logistical nightmare isnt it it really is i mean at first uh when we heard that there were rumors that the inauguration could move indoors um at first i thought could it be inside the white house could could could it take place inside the white house and if youre the moving company thats thats one heck of a nightmare isnt it because you dont really have much time to move joe bidens stuff out and then to move donald trumps in but as you mentioned there it is inside the capital uh the retunda um and i was here for the joe b inauguration four years ago and that was freezing its always really cold but uh it is predicted to be much colder um i think it will be even colder than it was during barack obamas inauguration i wasnt here for that but that was in and the high temperatures was fah the low and there were wind chills that were you know that were unbearable uh and so uh yes this decision couldnt have been taken lightly i imagine but its you know quite something for this to happen just just a few days before the inauguration takes place it really is because its not just the incoming president that those organizers have to worry about its all those dignitaries and guests and world leaders that now have to be taken to a separate place so im sure more of those details will emerge over the next little while that news has only just broken
LIJdWJnChdA,outrage as indian government blocks bbc documentary on pm modi from airing,as india celebrates its th republic day controversy in the country continues over the latest shahrukh khan bollywood film and a bbc documentary these have triggered a public outcry and reignited debates about press freedom and freedom of expression in the country rebecca bundon reports from mumbai bollywood superstar shahruk khans new blockbuster bataan is drawing in the crowds to the cinemas but its also attracting a lot of controversy with attacks and protests by rightwing hindu groups in parts of india including at some theaters in madhya pradesh screenings of the film marking muslim actor sharik khans big comeback had to be canceled because of protests muslims also stage protests in response the main objection of hindu groups is that the lead actress difika padukone wears a saffron colored bikini during a sequence of a song the collar is considered to be a symbol of spirituality and hinduism and some groups say that this hurts their religious sentiments this comes as critics say that divisions between muslims and hindus in india have been exacerbated under the countrys hindu nationalist government meanwhile a bbc documentary which looks at prime minister narendra modis role as chief minister of gujarat during deadly riots in the state in is also causing an outcry the indian government banned online sharing of the program calling the documentary a propaganda piece designed to push a particular discredited narrative mr modi has denied allegations that as chief minister he failed to stop the rioting in his home state in which more than a thousand people were killed many of whom were muslims students at some universities have screened the documentary despite the ban but the internet and power supply was allegedly cut off as a student union at delhis jnu tried to show the documentary police arrested several students from another university over a screening commentators say that such incidents in india are highlighting religious tensions and raising questions about issues around freedom of expression and the free press rebecca bundon cna mumbai the outcry against the ruling bjp partys growing media crackdown sits in stark contrast to the colorful celebrations held to ma indias th republic day the main highlight of the event was a vibrant parade displaying military might and cultural diversity in the worlds largest democracy but all that glitters is not gold critics say that increasing censorship by prime minister narendra modis government has put indias democracy at risk and for more neha punya joins us live from new delhi neha how have these recent controversies impacted republic day celebrations in india hold on this is a day that celebrates indias constitutions and the many many freedoms that are given to indian citizens and protected by the constitution which is why doesnt our controversy over the bbc documentary over the screening of shahrukh khans new movie has led to many asking how uh the things that have happened this week with the government banning the bbc documentary a crackdown on universities where screenings were held detention of students how all of this can happen in a robust democracy there are many are asking questions about why there isnt enough of an outcry about declining press freedom about attacks on personal liberties including the freedom of expression as well but the many who are also siding with the government these are supporters of prime minister modi who agree with the governments labeling of that documentary as a propaganda piece many calling it a colonial relic saying that just like the government is rejecting indias colonial legacy by building a new parliament by putting the focus back on regional languages over english similarly india has the right to reject criticism leveled against it by the west now how all eyes are going to be on how narendra modis government responds to these issues how might that response impact the bjp party as a whole perhaps in the upcoming polls well its certainly given the opposition a lot of ammunition as we look ahead to the elections and a lot of crucial state elections this year as well for example the congress party has criticized the governments use of emergency powers to take down many of the links that are being shared to the documentary on twitter and youtube saying that clearly the bjp has something to hide the congress party is also organizing a screening of this banned documentary in the state of kerala today theyre saying that the government cannot stop people from accessing the truth on what happened in the riots but its important to remember that mr modi remains hugely popular hes won two massive mandates in the last two general elections and current ratings project him to still be very much in the lead compared to other leaders in the country and part of the reason is that his biggest support base is the hindu voter and those voters are unlikely to be debtored by the criticism that the government is now facing over censorship as well as a crackdown on freedom of expression neha thank you for the update live from new delhi

ZAQGoXIkTlw,climate change carbon dioxide rises more than ever in bbc news,now last year saw the fastest annual rise in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the earths atmosphere thats according to data collected and uh analysis from a research station in hawaii the study from the uks met office has warned that co at current levels are incompatible with the target of keeping global temperatures below concentrations of co and now higher than before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels last year was the hottest on record with global temperatures de above preindustrial levels lets speak now to professor of earth system science at stanford university and also chair of the global carbon project rob jackson uh mr jackson hello welcome to the program how worried should we be how worried should we be what do those figures mean well we should be very worried this is a much larger increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide than were used to um were breaching uh safe temperature levels well past them and um and i think the most troubling thing about the increase this year is that its not caused primarily by a surge in fossil fuel emissions we estimate fossil fuel emissions are up about last year in but normally the earths lands take up about onethird of of of uh fossil carbon pollution uh through tree growth and other things and the earth is starting to fight back um the el nino last year meant thousands of additional fires in the amazon record droughts in the amazon and elsewhere plants are not growing as fast and um were seeing forest death in places so the earth is is um starting to uh rebel if you will and um and thats deeply troubling you say the earth is fighting back i mean the earths just going to get off with get on with things isnt it its us thats going to to suffer its going to correct itself somehow um this figure um of deges you know i think its its accepted now isnt it that were going to be heading above that is the most realistic figure of a temperature rise that well be able to attain is is that the agreed level well i hope not certainly we are heading uh towards that now were not um slowing down at we you know a couple decades ago it would have been inconceivable that we would have so casually and cavalierly blown by the c threshold where we are now but we did and we may do the same for and head above which is a deeply troubling world with sea level rise ice melt and extreme weather we do not want to go there but were we just seem to be sort of whistling down the street ignoring whats happening around us okay so so in terms of what is happening why are we say seeing this this fastest rate of carbon dioxide entering the earths atmosphere i mean we weve got the cops weve got the statements weve got the increase in renewable um energy why are we still burning more fossil fuels and and where where is this concentrated well were burning more fossil fuels in almost all regions of the earth europe is the the primary region really the only region where fossil fuel emissions have actually decreased so so thank you for for all of your efforts but elsewhere um were burning more one thing were doing around the world is producing more and more energy so were building uh wind turbin and and solar panels but because theres so much extra demand for energy that renewable infrastructure does not mean that were taking fossil plants like natural gas and in some places coal offline and we need to take fossil plants offline and replace them with clean energy are we going to do that do you think do think its attainable because it it looks as if uh mans development and what needs to be done to protect the earth i mean they dont correspond at all i mean one of the latest concerns is that the growth of ai and the energy needed of course to cool those those huge um sources and and and the the power thats needed to generate and and all the processing the energy thats needed there where is this energy going to come from fossil fuel isnt it to some extent theres a discussion here in the united states about extending the lifetimes of coal plants that were scheduled to be taken offline in the next few years because of so much extra demand for for energy partly coming from data centers and ai and things like that we have an insatiable appetite for energy and that appetite means we need renewables and nuclear and were still burning fossil fuels instead of um reducing emissions okay prof professor rob jackson i was about to get on nuclear there but ive run out of time uh thank you very much indeed thank you thank you
B_KM4JF5VBg,india election narendra modi set for third term but opposition still to concede bbc news,hello im nikki schiller welcome to the program we start this hour in india where the prime minister narendra modi is due to start talks on forming a coalition government his bjp party is celebrating but it failed to secure a majority on its own for the first time in years his nda block secured seats above the mark needed to form a government mr modi thanked voters for their mandate and said he would do everything to eradicate corruption and poverty the worlds biggest election was held over weeks with almost a billion people registered to vote our first report is from our correspondent aruna muki in delhi victory celebrations at the bjp headquarters in new delhi prime minister narendra modi returning to power for a record third ter the victory bittersweet mods aim of crossing seats unfulfilled in his victory speech choosing to call it a win for his nda alliance and not a win for the bjp on this piest day it is definite that the national democratic alliance will make a government for the third consecutive time we are all very grateful to the people of this country as they have expressed their trust in the bjp and the nda over two dozen indian opposition parties had united to form the india alliance to take on the bjp the grouping doing much better than expected opposition leader rahul gandhi called the alliances improved performance a verdict against modis style of politics to a question on whether he may still try and cobble up a bigger alliance to form the government gandhi remained noncommittal india the opposition india alliance meeting on june th where our alliance will decide our next move there is a very fine line to make the majority so we will do whatever the alliance decides what was why anticipated to be a runaway election wasnt to be and after years of the bjps absolute majority india will be returning to coalition politics where consensus will be key and aruna day joins me live now from delhi so the election much closer than had been expected which means mr modi has to have those talks with his coalition partners what are we expecting today and thats exactly what the focus will be all through the day today uh uh nikki as both the ruling nda alliance of the bjp led by the bjp meets with its partners uh we will also see a meeting taking place of the opposition parties who uh banded together to form the india alliance so theyre all meeting together so what were seeing now since morning are regional party leaders who are based in different states are now flocking to delhi where they will be meeting the leadership of the national parties like the bjp and the congress to try and deliberate on a strategy about what happens next and this is where the key to what will happen next lies because these will be hectic deliberations where there will be different parties who are addressing their own domestic constituencies who will seek to get the best deal for themselves because so far over the last years the ruling bhia jan party of prime minister narendra modi has not had to rely on alliance partners to ensure that his government carries on functioning this time they will have to give consensus they will have to get consensus there will be give and take for instance there will be some parties which will say i want that particular ministry or i would like this i would like to be this in the government which means dislodging existing bjp ministers and putting in alliance partners so this is where the story lies so its not the end of it at all there will be conversations there are also feelers that opposition parties are sending out to their alliance partners to see if they can cobble up a larger alliance yes on that with the opposition theyve not conceded so is it theoretically possible for them to form a government its difficult but well you cant rule out anything in indian politics because right now the key lies with a lot of the regional parties in the country who have a history of switching sides depending on what the political climate really is im speaking based on what weve seen in indian politics over the last several decades where india has been in an era of coalition politics weve seen parties switch sides overnight so that is definitely a possibility which is why there is a big opposition alliance meeting later at india time in the evening where all the alliance part will be there there are also reports that some feelers have been sent out to parties which are currently in the nda who have historically also been in the opposition alliance in the past so that is also something significant because if they manage to convince them and if they manage to have these kind of positive conversations then there still might be a picture where you are seeing the opposition alliance going beyond the mark it is difficult because they dont have the numbers at the moment and some parties who are with the ruling india alliance have confirmed that they remain with them but again everyone is also punctuating that statement by saying we are going to be in talks we will decide what the next course of action will be could be a complicated day ahead ar day thank you very much for the latest there live from delhi and a reminder we have a live page up and running with the very latest reaction and analysis on the indian election results and those talks that will be going on today from reporters across the country you can follow it on the bbc news website or app
ZM2W7XevO9I,how the indiacanada fallout could affect trade and immigration bbc news,now there was a time when india and canada considered each other the close ally these pictures show prime ministers trudeau and modi at more cordial times but this week tensions between the two nations which were already bad nose di nose dived both india and canada have now expelled diplomats from their host countries on wednesday canadas prime minister justin trudeau had this to say as ive said a number of times we are not looking to provoke or create a fight with india uh the indian government made a horrific mistake in thinking uh that they could uh interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of canada justus in trudo there will a lot of the tensions come down to the killing of this man hardip singh nja a seik man who was killed in canada last year he was part of the kistan movement which is advocating for a separate homeland for seeks in india something strongly opposed by the indian government well canadas governments accused indian officials of being involved in that well in a recent statement indias foreign ministry spokesperson rand jwell said canadas presented us no evidence whatsoever in the support of the serious allegations that its chosen to level against india and indian diplomats meanwhile in another development today the us has charged a former indian intelligence officer vikas yadov of allegedly directing a foiled plot to murder a prominent seek separatist in new york last year its the first time the indian governments been directly implicated in this way well to discuss all those developments lets speak to jeff nanel a former consul general of canada in hong kong and the ceo of the asia pacific foundation of canada welcome to the program um first of all where do you see things at the moment i assume you have more of a canada perspective on this but how bad are relations between india and canada uh there theres no question i think that that they are the worst that they have been in decades uh it it started uh this latest uh situation started over a year ago when prime minister trudeau first rose in canadas house of commons in september last year uh to level allegations of involvement of agents of the indian state in the murder of a canadian citizen in in vancouver in the pre the previous june but what we had uh earlier this week on on monday was really an unprecedented scene where we had the canadian the head of canadas national police the royal canadian mounted police uh in a press conference talking about uh over individuals uh who are are being arrested and charged with uh various crimes across canada uh related to extortion intimidation coercion and and even murder uh targeting members of uh the canadas uh indian diaspora community particularly members of the of the seek faith jeff im just going to jump in just to kind of zoom out a bit because we dont have a huge amount of time and first of all on the specific allegations around nar whos on screen next to you india says that canadas presented no evidence its important to put that perspective out there as well but just to say more broadly because we dont have a huge amount of time is there any way to walk things back to the place where india and canada once were where you know things were very cordial between the two i remember in justin trudeau being the guest of honor as he visited narendra modi in india there were some controversies around that particular trip but certainly there was a good relationship is there any way to walk it back well the there theres two different elements to this i i think the relationship between the governments of prime minister modi prime minister trudeau its going to be very difficult uh to see how those would improve as long as these judicial processes are going on in canada so that train is already in motion but its important also to remember there there is a a a trade and investment relationship between canada and india that has continued to grow uh not not rapidly in the last year but it has continued to grow in spite of the differences between the two governments so on a society to society level and uh when it comes to commerce uh its a its a different picture the question now is whether this latest escalation will uh which has not spilled over into the trade and investment sphere whether that will happen now with these latest developments and and this is something well have to see in the coming days okay jeff and nan cavel thank you very much for joining us and sharing your perspective on those deteriorating relationships between india and canada
SF4P7PsqX6A,india election counting underway after million people voted bbc news,counting is underway in india after the countrys mammoth elections which concluded on saturday ballot boxes and electronic voting machines have been opened at heavily guarded polling stations results should come in later today the indian election commission says a record million people voted early results show that prime minister narendra modis bjp party has taken a lead samir hussein has this report cruising into this election prime minister narendra applause music modi fueled by agulation and hindu centric music ideology his main opponent rahul gandhi heir of a political dynasty leader of indian national congress before the elections kicked off their bank accounts were frozen by the government this is not freezing of the congress partys banks bank accounts this is the freezing of indian democracy congress built a coalition with dozens of other political parties to counter mr modi they say the prime minister used intimidation to prevent a fair campaign politicians were raided chief ministers jailed initially the modi campaign was all about promoting his accomplishments but quickly turned to islamophobic messaging go here mr modi telling supporters if the opposition wins they will redistribute your wealth and give it to muslims first they reject claims their islam phobic but divisive politics plays to his base this by the prime minister of a secular country and the worlds largest democracy and samira joins us live now from delhi hello samira hi there look we came into these elections expecting a resounding victory for prime minister narendra modi n is bjp party but if you look now at the results were seeing that its actually a little bit more of a fight we see that the bjp le coalition or that alliance theyre leading by seats now they are leaning in that direction for those seats by no means an official tally and when you look at the india alliance thats the alliance made up of the congress party and other political parties theyre running at about seats now to parse out some of that im joined now by aj bos he is a political commentator and has written many books about indian politics thank you for coming i want to start by asking you how would you characterize these elections well i think uh if the leads hold because we still dont have most of the results yet its a a huge huge victory for an opposition which everybody thought would be wiped out it is i think a blow to mr modi personally because the bjp itself is still well below a majority and of course with its allies it can i think comfortably uh form a government but uh the bjp everybody had expected the main exit polls had said that it would just wipe out the opposition and it would get even a bigger victory than last time which was huge so i think its quite amazing that indian democracy is still alive were not looking at a one party uh you know dictatorship uh and um so i think its good for india overall what i want to know is sort of what happened on the campaign trail we saw that mr modi went from campaigning on his accomplishments over the last several years but then there was a significant shift in tone and we started hearing more divisive language and and some hate speech why that change well i think uh this is not the first time my that he uh and other bjp leaders have used divisive language but um during national elections he usually stays away from this uh this time uh after the first few phases i think there was a feeling in the bjp that the news wasnt good particularly from utar pradesh which is the largest state in india with you know um really about about about of the seats so i think that that caused him to get his hindu core base uh to mobilize them but it doesnt seem to have worked that well judging from the leads in utar pradesh now given all of that given what were seeing in terms of the results there have also been accusations of democratic backsliding some institutions being attacked and im wondering given what were seeing in terms of the trends of the election what does that mean for a potential modi le government well its too early to say i mean i can almost certainly say it will be a bjp government i dont know itll be a modi l government as i said uh mr modi was on a pedestal coming down from that pedestal is going to be difficult for him but certain certainly itll be um a more chasen bgp when it comes back to power and i dont think that we shall see the kind of assault on institutions uh which we saw before which i think they were led to do getting a second successive term with even enhanced majority i think any diminishing of that electoral majority for the bjp itself uh is going to i think um you know make a difference this has certainly turned out to be a much more exciting election especially given what we were thinking as we were coming into these elections and what were seeing now in terms of those results samir hussein thank you very much indeed thank you and if youd like more on the story do head to the bbcs news website there is a live page running right now with all the latest updates and results as theyre coming in so head to the website or of course you can download the bbc news app and you can see some of those images uh which are updated minute by minute in some cases

the world this plan i think its ground onto quite practical things that need to happen now the key will be on implementation and how the country uk can move forward with implementing all the different aspects that have been outlined by k yeah ian the prime minister talked about the uk being the world leader in ai but the us is just so dominant in this sector at the moment are there gaps there that the uk could potentially exploit yeah so i think he made a really important point where he said yes i mean the big tech companies they are in the uk and theyre in china um and its really important that the uk first of all according to k attracts talent and skills and also these big tech companies one element that is important is to also find the niche where the uk can really lead globally so for example the big call on how we can green data centers how we can make them responsible we can make it sustainable how they uk can lead on not just sustainability for ai but also ai that is really sustainable i think those are very important element so i really think its important that areas like sustainable artificial intelligence we know that ai consumes a lot of energy so efficient tms greening data centers that are going to be built ai literacy not just skills there is one important point in my view that i would like to see very much addressed its not just about uh ai skills its not just about large tech companies its also about equipping management in companies large and smalls in the uk to understand how they can transform with ai how they can use ai and go beyond the glamour to really understand how ai can increase productivity and how they can make things more efficient and this is also important for workers and employees i understand that often there is fear about jobs but if employees can be taken along they are the ones who know the product they know productivity within their own firm so changing from a mindset of fear around the eye to a mindset of growing with ai so that a lot of people use ai employees can take part in this transformation in what i think can equip britain on the ai path one of the other things that people are really concerned about or fearful of as you say is this issue of privacy and thats one of the areas that you very much deal with around data collection as well and surveillance even the use of things like facial recognition how many gaps are there still in the regulatory frameworks around ai given the global nature of it that still need to be plugged around some of these concerns yeah look the main issue about artificial intelligence is that it needs a lot of data and especially the new technologies especially generative ai which is when you can create video text they are built by scraping a lot of data out of the web and there are very much questions that are still open so privacy but also copyright on which the uk has launched a consultation now the issue is how the uk can invest on privacy preserving technologies on anonymization that really works so that people can trust giving their data or sharing their data data is a public asset its really important to remember that but it has to be treated with extreme care because its us its us people its not something that we can sell it belongs to us it defines us so i think its really important to invest in privacy and enabling technologies in technologies that can enable questioning of algor without necessarily accessing the data um and this is where i think a lot of the future lies if the uk as tarma was correctly say is very much proud of the history around innovation and science and inventions then i think this is an area where the uk can lead which is how to code legal protection privacy security safety robustness into artificial intelligence to me this is a very important element for the uk to invest in its so interesting to get your perspective aana bti thank you very much for joining us thank you
Hrr0rZLHqv0,covid in india why is the government playing down the crisis bbc newsnight,with the abject misery and suffering that the massive coronavirus surge has brought on india has also come controversy over whether the indian government contributed to the crisis not just by playing down the risks before this second wave but also through attempts at censorship in recent days most obviously in getting twitter to block many posts in india relating to the pandemic among those the indian government got blocked were tweets by opposition politicians talking about prime minister modis mismanagement of the pandemic or just highlighting the scale of the crisis and strain on the health care system even pictures posted by a photojournalist of the funeral pyres burning was blocked as were tweets critical of large religious gatherings by the ukbased lawyer and academic mirza beg it is surprising that these tweets were removed but it is not the first time that such such action has been taken by the government in the past also we have seen how information that is critical of the government or that exposes actions of the government that are excessive in kashmir or in other places and other issues that the indian government is engaged in they have taken the first step that they take is to cut off communications delete information so critics say this is indicative of the way that india which is now out of in the world press freedom index deals with criticism prime minister modis communications director says its not censorship i think we need to differentiate between the issue of censorship and the legitimate concerns of governments uh not only in india but around the world uh to the issue of fake news that is being uh propagated so one of the one of the tweets that was removed was was just a picture of funeral players burning there may be some context behind this it its possible that there are concerns at a local level for the law and order situation of that particular area or district i think you are getting a true picture the fact that um the bbc is very very actively reporting uh all sorts of aspects of the pandemic in india almost on a rolling basis um there will be concerns about whether its fair or not or whether its balance or not but you get the same uh arguments here in the uk and the same concerns in other parts do you have issues about do you have issues with the the reporting of india by the bbc i i do actually i do and i i i often um feel concerned that there isnt a um there isnt a balanced uh narrative around uh the reporting that it is tends to be focused upon the negative he did acknowledge its been hard to put a positive spin on whats happening in the country today but a highly defensive posture by the indian government towards news seen as negative is something critics have become used to anytime people try to criticize the government the assumption that is being used and it is being used as a weapon against them is that you are criticizing the nation you are enemies of the nation if you criticize the government and what needs to be understood is that governments will come and go but the loss of lives the the the suffering that is going on right now this is irreparable the people who have lost their lives do not need to lose their lives this is not something which cannot be addressed it is the failure it is the negligence of the government that is causing this to happen and we have a right to criticize the government many indian health experts have been saying the vastly underestimated official figures of infections and deaths are ongoing attempts to play down the scale of the crisis but it is getting harder to control this tragic narrative alain mcball with that report well earlier i asked gopal agarwal the national spokesman for the bjp the governing party why the government had taken so long to admit to the crisis no no the government has not turned a blind eye the first wave was very well controlled by the governments state center and other institutions like icmr medical pharma companies medical fraternities frontline workers and we were expecting second wave but the uh the modeling etc or the economist or the medical professional nobody expected that the second wave will be so severe and it will be so widespread and so intense you have failed to implement a lockdown even now with well over new cases a day youve had a catastrophic shortage of oxygen a black market for medicines people dying on the streets outside hospitals doctors describing how theyre unable to cope they dont have supplies and they dont have space and you havent even stopped electoral campaigning or religious gatherings that are bringing more people together uh there is certain narration which is influencing the which is being influenced by the social media and certain western press also australia and other which are very hostile to indian uh dispensation they are creating some this kind of narration i would just like to put in fact when the elections were declared in india that time the rate of new covet patient had fallen down to and when you can stop those at any point you can stop your electioneering at any point that whilst countries like the uk and the us and many around the world have been scrabbling to help india in a time of crisis your prime minister modi was at a political rally his home minister amit shah was alongside him on the streets at a political rally why werent they focusing on the crisis and people dying at home there are five state elections which were going on the four states election were completed by th of april by th of april the number of cases was there only per day so that is not the situation later on when suddenly there was a skirt from the second wave yeah and the bhartijanta party in itself had declared that we will not hold public rallies and prime minister cancelled his rallies and that point of time after that we have not been holding public rallies and and when people pointed out what was going wrong when for example molly gattack wrote an mp wrote on twitter india will never forgive the pm for underplaying the corona situation in the country letting so many people die due to mismanagement you shut down social media tweets like that when you have a reuters journalist danish siddiqui who said never imagined id be a witness to these scenes in my hometown coronavirus continues to wreak havoc in new delhi indias national capital you shut down those posts you dont let people see them why are you spending your time shutting down social media posts instead of dealing with the crisis your information is completely incorrect one thing i tell you that there were many instances of which have been pointed out by the government where same words same sentences and same uh multiple sentences which were completely copied and being transmitted and tweeted from different handles which were originating not from our country but were originating from outside the indian bar youre a democracy youre the biggest democracy in the world you can handle criticism cant you no no this is not the right perspective that you are taking every country twitter etc have to comply and all social platform have to comply with the rules of the rules and regulation of the content by the country when our government pointed out that these twitter handles or this toolkit instrument which are not conducive to the current uh national interest and which are completely uh based on fake news and we which are based in with an agenda those and which the twitter and other social media agree well its an agenda currently mentioned it that we have received this uh and uh we have a independent judiciary if somebody has any objection to central government or any government they can go to the court and that will see whether let me ask you something very simple is it unpatriotic to criticize the indian government for people in your country to criticize the indian government and what prime minister modi is doing is it unpatriotic if they write these things on twitter and im quoting directly from the posts that have been taken down if you make a concerted effort and take a fake news and false narration and build that and create panic out of the crisis every government has the right to control the panic multiple people are dying that fake news and false news you want to say that we should allow this you dont see any criticism of indian government and modi government on in the social media if you are completely blind to that then i cannot help you but criticizing the state government various institutions everything is open well lets look at some of the criticism that has made it through them one newspaper predator we just spoke to from the caravan magazine has accused your government of trying to massage the figures of the death rate so the world didnt know how badly india was coping we also know of a crematorium in madhya pradesh where bodies were cremated in one day and government data reported just three everything will be investigated if there are people the investigation authority is there judiciary is scrutinizing there are other fires being launched all these issues are taken care of but this kind of narration building is not correct if you cant find any criticism of the government in indian media then i think you are completely keeping your eyes closed i just read you the criticism but gopala garwell thank you very much indeed thank you for joining us my pleasure my pleasure well joining us now is shakuntala banaji professor of media culture and social change at lse and raheel koshid who was formerly twitters head of news politics and government for southeast asia and was based in delhi raheel if i can start with you you just heard the bjp spokesman theyre telling me how they only took down stuff that they thought was or they deemed to be irresponsible or believed to be fake news or come with an agenda or from foreign sources your response to that thats absolutely incorrect weve seen uh the order on the lumen database thats hosted by harvard uh and most of the tweets its about tweets theyre by uh indian lawmakers filmmakers journalists and and regular twitter users uh this assumption this assertion that they came they originated outside of india were and and and somehow were you know in contravention of indian laws uh is is absolutely and totally false uh you know its its very typically a problem of someone basically having a hammer and everything to that person looking like every problem to that person looking like a nail the bjp is modified the bjp government has modified indias internet rules that gives the authorities immense powers to basically send arbitrary orders to platforms like twitter and others so they can have have content that they simply do not like taken down would you accept that in a pandemic the indian governments particularly concerned with uh panicking a population so if people see shots of of funeral powers or crematoriums that look overwhelming then people get more panicked well thats a thing in a pandemic the indian government should be concerning itself with diffusing the situation rather than diffusing the news of the situation if there are people lining up outside crematoriums waiting for their turns for over you know to to hours uh what you should be busy busy figuring out is to how to defuse that situation what you should be busy figuring out is to how to get oxygen to hospitals hospitals in delhi have had to come to twitter and tag the prime minister himself for oxygen supply instead of addressing those things his government is busy taking down tweets okay let me bring in uh because on the other side weve also got a sense of what people are saying about distributing of misinformation on the part of the government just uh chicano just talk us through what youre seeing there so weve been studying um networks of disinformation and misinformation in india for some years now and weve been looking very closely at the link between the vilification of anyone who is a dissident against the government and of minorities such as muslims and christians and the connection to this vast network of some paid and some unpaid supporters of the bjp and the hindu far right they have a network of whatsapp groups twitter facebook groups sharechat groups which actually operate as a sort of informal public sphere in conjunction with the mainstream media a lot of which has also fallen foul of um free speech and just swallowed hook line and sinker the line of the government about certain things so lets just look at what happened briefly last year at the beginning of the first lockdown when very very quickly it became apparent that a group of people called the tablighi jamaat a muslim group were being blamed quite unfairly as it turned out through the courts for spreading um covered and since they had met before the lockdown was actually announced and this went through thousands and thousands of whatsapp groups in in really monstrous language and politicians were quoted calling for them to be boycotted from saying that muslims were spreading covert by spitting on vegetables it was it was really a horrific scene out there meanwhile of course the lockdown was so badly managed that many people died of starvation and dehydration but very little of that made it into public news let me ask you raheel because youre from the twitter family dont you feel that twitter is part of the problem here that its complying with what its being asked to do by the government in terms of shutting down criticism well twitter has to comply they are incorporated in india as a legal entity in february as well uh there was an order that was issued to twitter for the takedown of about or or tweets for which there had been a total compliance then that was rolled back into a partial compliance im not sure if theyre going to be doing the same thing here i hope they do but the rules are laid out such that as twitter if you receive this order under indias it rules you have to comply within a certain time frame otherwise you risk jail time or up to seven years for your staff what twitter can do is now go to a court and challenge this order in the court or uh simultaneously roll back some of the some of the compliance and chicano when youre talking about this sort of army of paid or unpaid is that what we would think of as as basically bots um you know so sort of basically uh automated responses is is that what youre seeing no actually uh its really interesting you should say that because there is absolutely evidence that there are bots and possibly around a third of the the twitter followers of many of the major politicians for the ruling party and even for some of the other parties happen to be bots or happen to be some kind of automated um some kind of automated machine but actually what were seeing is that the paid it cells um are tweeting out things are going into whatsapp groups are members of hundreds of whatsapp groups despite the best efforts of platforms which have absolutely not been good enough so i think its a real moral failure and political failure on the part of platforms to say that they have not been able to control this because these people are very clearly doing exactly what the spokesperson you just talked to said theyre retweeting exactly the same things theyre putting exactly the same kinds of memes and gifts with hateful materials with lying materials into these whatsapp groups and they are poisoning the public sphere they are also spreading medical misinformation around covert and coronavirus for instance just to give you an example we spoke last year two years ago we spoke with a man who said that he operated something like um whatsapp groups uh he was the administrator of whatsapp groups that he was um he ran twitter lots and lots of twitter handles and that he said he was doing this seven days a week he was just literally doing this and he said in a very matteroffact way were out of time but thank you both im fascinating to to hear from both of you

compete with the rival band the loser has to give up the great bay land for free a bunch of trash you youve gone too far ha the ability of your classical orchestra is good but classical music is destined to be no match for modern music tim you ungrateful trader how dare you team up with foreigners to compete for our land well the strongest dominates in business we had a deal before the contest classical music competed with western music the winner would get the land trina is just our manager mr shay isnt here what she said doesnt count weve already signed the contract with trina and stamped it with your firms seal even if gerald shows up hell have to accept it miss holder is the airs of her family she learned the music at the top academy in this competition m holder is the key m

firm seal you lost the competition are you here to regret it since weve stamped the contract we will definitely keep our promise great mr shay is so generous in this case the great bay property now belongs to mr allen hold on i ive read the contract according to the contract the two groups have to send their teams until they can no longer co compete and admit defeat yes i havent played yet miss holder our band members are all music masters if you lose youll become a joke i will never allow your men to become the lead here your modern music is not worthy of comparison with our classical music looks like youre quite confident in this case im going to show you how impressive we are gerald i will win this competition and help you get the land our modern music is internationally renowned and has a long history but only a few people enjoy your classical music its worthless lets perform together today ill let you lose with sincere conviction lets get started its ambush on all sides miss holder your classical music is really applause vulnerable miss holder is from a scholarly family she is proficient in various instruments and one numerous awards its a piece of cake to win a foreigner yeah everyone in river city knows m holders musical talent in this competition miss holder is sure to win no trina is what going to lose youre just a cleaner what do you know are you trying to encourage a foreigner to undermine ours what do you mean why do you say that now trina clearly has the upper hand trinas basic skills and talent are great but shes too impatient and too forceful if she doesnt calm down she will definitely lose very soon claire youre just jealous of m holders talented see youve no right to criticize miss holders abilities miss holder hang in there she cant push any harder miss holder is about to win thats all youve got now its my turn music your classical instrument is good but its still no match for my music violin mr shay m holders hand is already injured she cant compete again gerald its all because of her if she didnt talk nonsense i wouldnt be distracted and lose the contest its all her fault why is it my fault its because youre impatient you enough mr shay this time you have no players right no no matter how many players come to challenge your music is still no match for our music classical music is rubbish oh mr shay you were unbeatable in business many people praised you this is why your company became an international rising star in just a few years it was all just luck hey mr shay whether it was luck or strong capability you lost terribly today from now on everyone will look down on your classical music you will lose your reputation over the world even in our country youll be despised for ruining classical music no no way it wont happen why wouldnt it happen no matter how capable mr shay is once he loses peoples trust no one will believe him the sha group will collapse gerald im sorry all right gerald accept your defeat hold on the competition isnt over yet claire youre just a cleaner stop causing trouble mr shay no rule says cleaners cant join the contest right no such rules you want to compete with them you dont push yourself no since i was disqualified from that competition i havent played for years do you believe me gerald i lost the competition shes just a cleaner from the countryside shell only make it worse i trust her you mr shay youve kept changing your players what do you want mr tim this is the last round its a rubber game if we lose i will give up this land good i agree okay since mr allen has agreed lets get started whats your instrument since its a contest between modern and classical music lets play together do you dare why not music is hierarchical ill let you lose with sincere conviction today lets show them the elegance of classical music how do we compete you can choose any song you like what a big talk you go first for who has the upper hand now now theyre evenly matched at the moment its too close to call why hasnt cla started yet could it be she cant play it i didnt expect cla to be amazing cla is really something we won we won thank music applause you mr shay i won impressive miss johnston i underestimated you music knows no borders the tamber of the instruments is equal modern and classical music have their own features and strengths theyre the same thanks for this lesson lets go mr music allen claire youre amazing its not just my effort thanks to everyones hard work yes yes everyone deserves credit but you are the greatest i right yes well wheres miss holder she left a while ago i think she knew miss mr shay would deal with her so she ran away first m holder has been here for so long but she never makes achievements this time she nearly caused the firm a big loss she doesnt deserve her position how about making claire the manager trina stole the company seal ignored company rules and made a huge mistake i wont let her off now trina is dismissed from her manager position also you go to hr tomorrow and choose a new manager sure mr shay this time thanks to claires help i think shes suitable to be a manager yeah claire has strong organizational skills to handle unexpected situations shes well suited for this position being a cleaner is a waste of talent were okay with it me too all right its settled then i i cant i dont know what the job

through the list of actors who were born extremely rich and then become even richer as their careers went on also known as tao you might know him from his time on exo in korea before he left the group to make a career in china now he works as a singer actor and a host but even if it doesnt work the day in his life hell never have to worry about food or clothing because it was previously reported that taos father left him nearly billion yuan in asset he inherited this fortune from his father who died in september at the age of his father had invested heavily in taos career even helping him with the group exo in and establishing his own agency out child back in taos father was in the car business which is why you can often see tao posting all kinds of sports car famous watches and luxury houses on the internet according to a news item online taos father owned four to five mansions in qingdao alone and his beijing company has assets of over billion yen which is around billion dollars in his dad was named the seventh richest man in qingdao province imagine the first one but despite his immense wealth tao is known to be philanthropic having made a large donation to his birth city and province he could not get more attractive right now but even with this generous donation it will not prevent his private jet from flying around arthur chen you might know him for his works in lighter and princess legend of awakening and many more yep this guy has a prominent family background his father is chen kaige a wellknown director his mother is chen he an excellent actress and his cousin chen he is also a popular star not only a normal director his father is a leading figure of the fifth generation of chinese cinema winning at canness festival back in feiyu chose to be an actor presumably due to the influence of his parents he wanted to become an actor which is a very easy thing to do because his father is his biggest backer unfortunately the journey is not as smooth as he had hoped its also because he has such a strong family background that when he first came out to act many netizens were skeptical saying that he only got a part due to his connection but he was not discouraged instead he slowly settled himself in the entertainment industry and hone his acting skills in the past few years it can be clearly seen that his active skills have indeed improved to a certain extent and i hope that is only the beginning esther yu shuxin if were talking about wealthy actress you can never miss esther yu if you have watched the show youth with you you might remember her stunning appearance at the beginning of the program wearing a black short skirt a pearl necklace and a chanel bag that was worth an astounding yuan the bag she wore on the show it can only be purchased by highend vips but its not just her face and choices that have people talking esther yu comes from a wealthy family with assets totalling billion yen her father is a mining tycoon and her grandfather is a still tycoon well its what you expected in the most expensive area in shanghai she owns two large mansions youre right mansions with rive views where you can see oriental pearl tower from your window but its not just house and cars that are impressive her cloakroom is nearly a hundred square meters and with all kinds of chanel bags dont get me started on the watch yep the watch that she casually wears at the airport is a limited edition bulgari watch and only pieces exist in the world ill let you imagine the price on your own at only years old ester already had five companies under her name she also has amazing connections as liu jiaxi the daughter of the richest man in shanghai is her best friend well rich people just seem to stick together she is also a neighbor of zhao liying and huang xiaoming and its clear that not only is she wealthy but she is also well connected you might know him from the story of minglan where he acted as gu tingye and hes also zhao liyings exhusband in real life he was born in shanghai in and after becoming popular netizen dug out his family background and turns out hes not only the second generation rich but also third generation rich well another word for super rich his father was a tycoon in a textile industry and his business spread all over the country with a wellestablished business empire he once said in an interview that he basically made less than nothing from acting and only doing it because its fun but his life wasnt always easy because to motivate shao feng his father said to him at the beginning i wont give you any of my property and after several years of hard work shao feng finally bought a villa for his parents at the end of the day his father then gave him all of his wealth bridgette qiao xin you may have heard her name before from ode to joy and many of her other works but today were going to be diving into our background it all started when there were rumors about qiao xins relationship with actor yang yang that led many people to dig into her family background it was then discovered that bridge come from money like a lot of money netizens also discovered that her family owns a villa in shanghai which is where every inch of land is expensive and a luxury villa in canada some speculate that her parents are successful business people but she previously denied the claim saying that her family is well to do but many people said that if shes middle class then where does that make the rest of us but while netizens can only speculate qiao xins neighbor came out to confirm the speculations they wrote hello neighbor on the post and provided exterior photos of her mansions along with the location information i know its so intrusive right well many netizens then check her house price and found out that her home is worth million yen what many people dont know is bridgette never intended to become an actress she once said that acting was an accident for her and her dreams since she was a child was to become a teacher but as time went on she fell in love with acting and has been making a name for herself in the industry this guy really likes to keep it lowkey even though its been very wealthy since he was a child for some of you dont know him he acted in the wolf fall in love with first kiss and many more darren wang inherited the family business but what he likes is acting so he entered the entertainment circle his father wang tai ching is an antique collector in taiwan he is also the person in charge of sotheby artworks co the biggest marketplace for art and luxury but it was not until april after darren participated in the opening ceremony of an art exhibition run by his father that everybody knew that wang tai ching was his father at the beginning though his father didnt agree with him acting saying that the entertainment industry is a tough world well hes got a point there but it wasnt until later on that his dad became so supportive of darrens choice so supportive that he bluntly said he would invest million dollars to support his son of which darren replied i have reminded him not to say such things again hes not in the entertainment industry so he doesnt understand these issues he also said ive come this far without ever depending on him unlike any other actors on this list who are super private that you cant find a single picture of their family on the internet wei daxun is out in the open in wei daxun and his parents participated in a reality show the man doing housework father and son then made their debut in a group under the name sofa two sons he dad is wei shaolin who used to be the executive director of this company and now works as the chairman of this company rumor has it that even though he has

few instances and it was enough to make our mouths drop the heartthrob was born in de leon a subprovincial port city in leoning province so how did he learn to speak english so well perhaps its out of

ZVo6oDgnYwY,why you cant understand chinese conversation drama and news by listening,hello everyone long time no see how are you doing i know many friends keep urging me to make new videos but because im really busy with work so i havent had time to chat with you for a long time its hard to have an empty night time i thought id chat with you all because its been a long time since i saw you how are you all doing lately you can tell me in the comments about my work lately although they said that after the double reduction policy double reduction policy is a new policy in china last year the government issued a something called double reduction policy it means students for elementary and middle school students lighten some of the burden they just dont want students to be too tired to study dont want to put too much pressure on my students so start double reduction double reduction would say some schools english test is removed english may become less important inside our primary and secondary schools so it means that because of this policy many foreigners probably foreigners living in china they are english teachers their job is an english teacher because of this policy many english teachers they probably just cant find a job so he went back to his country many many people say more and more foreigners in china recently back to their own country so that is to say possible chinese teacher not so much work anymore but strangely i find my work is getting more and more so maybe its still everyones enthusiasm for learning chinese still more and more because no matter what country we are in learning a language is a very important thing ok come on dont give up everyone knows today i like to share with you some problems i have encountered at work and what i see at work when my students are learning chinese some problems encountered so today i want to share with you problems that many students will encounter why intermediate and advanced students they are chatting with chinese watch chinese movies and tv series and when i listen to the news from china i cant understand today im just going to talk about why you dont understand why dont you understand many students have this problem there are many reasons the biggest one is probably they are not familiar enough with chinese maybe they have a problem with their tones or they dont know many words dont know much about grammar they may not understand but today we dont look for student questions what are your problems you yourself know im going to tell you today the problem you dont understand appears elsewhere my students often tell me teacher why when i am in class listen to you speak chinese i understand but me and my chinese friends with my chinese girlfriend chatting with my chinese boyfriend i dont understand what theyre saying in fact this problem is very common everyone knows that there are many dialects in china each of our cities has its own dialect so these dialects have their own accents we are not born to speak mandarin we are all born with parents speak in dialect with family then we started to learn mandarin in elementary school so when we speak mandarin when many chinese speak mandarin is accented to many chinese you may not know have a strong accent for example my hometown i am from guiyang i am from guiyang then in my hometown we dont have zh ch sh we dont have these three tones so all our zh ch sh in my hometown we all say zcs like eating in my home we say eat then for example the teacher is in my hometown we say lo s then the bus car we say gng jio c q c hu c i have spoken mandarin for too long in shanghai talking in your own dialect is suddenly a bit unaccustomed and in many cities we dont distinguish between n and l for example the teacher will become no s in my house my mother often says no s how is your no s so when you are chatting with chinese friends you do not understand you might want to know first when your friend speaks mandarin did he say his accent in it if he spoke his accent you dont understand its normal dont be nervous ok sometimes i dont understand i met an old man with a heavy accent when talking to me i dont understand what theyre saying so for the most part its not your problem is our language has an accent ok second question some students say ok i dont chat with my chinese friends they have an accent i can watch the movies and tv shows tv series and movies their mandarin should be the most standard right but they said again why when i watch tv series i still dont understand theyre talking too fast ok indeed i admit the tv show and the mandarin in the movie is very standard impossible to find an actor with an accent into a tv show right but there is also a problem everyone needs to know the current chinese tv drama market what about tv those of us who direct the movies when they choose actors they will choose good looking that is many people will choose goodlooking stars why because of those actors they have a lot of fans they have many fans then there are a lot of people who like them but these actors are very young they dont have much tv series and film training then when they are in the tv show when talking will be very relaxed then they wont speak clearly the sentences in the tv series they dont have that ability they dont know a tv show how to speak chinese clearly like now i am speaking in relaxing way if you dont listen carefully you may not understand what im saying but a good actor he will be very serious make every word clear let everyone watching the movie understand what hes saying so if you dont understand a movie what is the guy in a tv show saying most likely not your problem most likely its the actors problem sometimes without subtitles i dont understand a lot of young actors speaking they talk really fast then their ability to speak lines this is called ti c nng l their speaking skills arent particularly good either so its not just you if chinese watch tv series without subtitles we dont understand ok so if you dont understand do not be afraid you can try to cover the subtitles then find a chinese to listen to if he could understand this tv show is something you can practice if you find a chinese friend to listen to this drama he doesnt understand i think you can quit this show find someone who speaks mandarin very well in tv show or movie okay this is the second reason third the third thing i want to say is that many students say ok then i dont watch tv shows i dont talk to chinese either i listen to the news from china i think those people in the news speak mandarin probably are the best and most standard mandarin but they have a problem again teacher why i cant understand news ok if you know the chinese language you will know in chinese we have both spoken and written words spoken language is when we talk to others every day we use ku y for example im talking to you now this is oral spoken language is also the chinese that everyone learns in the book many foreigners must learn spoken language first right but there is a problem that in china we have a lot of written language that is the language we write more formal in reports news fiction articles there are also more formalthats about it we will use written language these words and the words we usually speak are different these words are more like a literary language literary language so when you are learning chinese basically we dont teach literary language because these languages are only available in writing just writing when writing official documents reports news fiction we will use what you heard in the news is also a literary language many students will use the news to practice listening like the chinese will always listen to bbc voa listen to bbc voa of course i dont know for foreign news the language they use and the language they usually speak is the same or not but in chinese language used in the news and the language we usually speak are totally different so if you dont understand the news thats normal like even my parents you show them a government document they may only understand so it doesnt matter if you dont understand the news do not worry its normal thats the three reasons i want to say why dont you understand first chinese who may you chat with you he has an accent the second is that when you are choosing to watch tv shows and movies must choose the wordswellsaid actor of course in tv shows and movies i want to say one more thing here in tv shows and movies in fact it is a product that spoken and literary language combine i mean when youre watching a tv show may hear spoken language may also hear things in written language literary language so the tv show is actually quite complicated you probably understand half of what you watch and dont understand half of it doesnt matter about the news i feel the news you can use them to practice your tones you can follow the announcer just to practice your tones but if you use news to practice listening probably not really that helpful yes it wont make you improve quickly yes so i think these resource of language learning lots of things can help you learn but you have to choose them according to your needs to choose what you want to practice for example you study chinese if you just want to chat with chinese just want to travel to china want to work in china you may just find some more chinese people to chat with you can also get used to the accents of different places that must be helpful for your language no is definitely helpful for your trip if you want to study in china study for example a masters degree study a phd i think you can take a look at the language of the news and reports and novels because when you are writing your thesis these words will definitely be used so whether you understand still dont understand it doesnt matter according to your needs to choose the material for practicing to choose the material for practicing thats what i want to say today it doesnt matter if you dont understand after you listened to my video today just think about what you need what do you need for chinese then go to practice repeat is enough okay thats what i want to say today if you are learning chinese you have other problems you can also write in the comments if i know then i would also make it in the next video share my experience with you nothing more to say thats it for today see you next time byebye

MyqhDKNig88,why traveling is important,music we all need a break from our everyday life going on a vacation is fun and fulfilling but you can gain a lot more by actually traveling exploring and being present at the places you visit here are some benefits of traveling it is better to spend your money on experiences rather than on m material things the memories you collect are like treasures they will remain forever and will bring you more happiness than some new clothes or other material things think how good it will feel when youre old and you look back to see not only an ordinary routine but also adventures and unique experiences you had gone through and not only when youre old ever a few years from now you can recall how much fun you had and plan your next adventure in the end you will not regret the things youve done but the things you didnt do traveling is a great opportunity to temporarily get away from your everyday life and look at it from a different point of view its so much easier to deal with issues and solve problems when you look at them from the outside while traveling you have a lot of time to think without distractions and make healthy decisions you will have a better perspective and maybe even realize that things are not that bad as you thought in our everyday life we are used to doing the same things meeting the same people going to the same places we basically live in our comfort zone when you travel you get out of your bubble you meet new people other travelers and locals youre exposed to different cultures you see different landscapes and views you experience new things you learn that the world is diverse and it helps you understand people that are different from you traveling actually makes you smarter you learn new things all the time when when you travel you get into unusual situations and face different challenges it makes you push your limits handle things better and come up with creative solutions after all the best way to learn is through experience traveling helps you to know yourself better youre out of your comfort zone and get to see your behavior in different situations sometimes even extreme ones you will be surprised to find out new things about yourself that you didnt know and decide what and how to improve the best part of traveling is the people you meet along the way you get to meet new people from countries around the world whom you would never have met in your daily life you listen to their stories tell yours hear various opinions and experience things together with people happiness is greater when shared with others traveling may sound scary or too challenging to some people and its okay just remember that you can choose your own kind of travel it doesnt have to be trekking in the mountains although that could be fun but you can do anything explore cities do some couch surfing relax in nature visit small villages and so on you will get more confident and learn what is good for you hey have a nice trip thank you for watching if you have any questions or requests just write down in the comments if you like the video please press the like button and subscribe to see future videos

IuTDuvYr7f0,how to spend days in japan a japan travel itinerary,japan the land of the rising sun from the mega city of tokyo to the mountainous region of the japanese alps japan is full of diverse and unique places waiting to be explored for many japan resides on the top of the list of places to visit and i was no different japan is one of my favorite countries to explore and i had the pleasure to visit once more ill be traveling through this amazing country visiting different cities and trying to cram all the essentials into a twoweek itinerary and ill be sharing it all with the goal to help you explore this fascinating country heres how i spent days in japan heres an overview of the journey ahead we arrive in osaka the kitchen of japan a city famous for its love of food and nightlife we then head to the secluded temple town of koyasan where well be staying overnight at a buddhist temple afterwards we visit the city of nara famous for the nara park and its deer population from nara we head to kyoto the ancient capital of japan rich in culture and traditions after kyoto we jump on the train and head up to kanazawa renown for its gold leaf production and housing one of the three great gardens in japan we then continue to the mountainous region of takayama where we explore the old town and relax at a japanese onsen and finally our twoweek journey ends with tokyo while in the city we spend the remaining time visiting the most essential spots before we begin heres a few things youll need to know we decided to visit japan in november during the autumn season and its by far my favorite season to visit due to the beautiful autumn foliage and mild weather conditions public transportation will be the main way to get around for that youll need to get your hands on an ic card ic cards are rechargeable travel cards that can be used to pay for fares and even buy goods in some stores they work in most major cities but for more remote areas youll need to purchase a specific local ticket a quick word on the japan rail pass if you follow this itinerary strictly you will not be needing the jr pass a jr pass is great if youre planning to do a roundtrip since it will cover the return trip expenses but since this is a pointtopoint trip meaning were starting in osaka and finishing in tokyo its actually more affordable going with singlefare tickets for navigation ive always been using google maps in japan it works well and even tells you the connections youll need to make for more detailed information and planning ahead i recommend checking out the website hyperdia we begin our journey in osaka osaka is known for being the kitchen of japan with many of the nations favorite dishes originating from the city its a modern and lively place where the focus is on having a good time people just seem to speak louder here eat louder and drink more not that im complaining we arrived quite late in osaka and head towards our hotel after dropping off our belongings we immediately head to the dotonbori area in downtown osaka the area is known for the glicoman sign and being a busy tourist spot with neon lights shops and plenty of food options we explore the area and pick up a few treats along the way but it was time for a meal and we head to the ever popular ichiran ramen for its tonkotsu ramen it was lisas first time here and she definitely approves the next day we spent the morning at the namba yasaka shrine its a small shrine famous for its lion head stage if you plan to visit a lot of shrines and temples in japan then its always a good idea to know how to pay your respects heres a quick howto first ring the bell if there is one bow twice clap twice and bow once after finishing up at the shrine we arrive at the osaka castle the castle is one of japans most famous landmarks and it played a major role in the unification of japan during the th century for over years amerikamura has been known for being the center of japanese youth culture in osaka similar to harajuku of tokyo its here you can find the latest trendsetting fashion in osaka we opted to a little bit of shopping to see if we could find something interesting to get a better view of the city we decided to visit the umeda sky building while here you can access its famous observation deck which provides a great view over the entire city of osaka as dinner time arrives we head arguably to my favorite okonomiyaki shop in the city okaru okonomiyaki are these savoury japanese pancakes made of flour eggs cabbage and the protein of your choice don quijote is a well known discount chain in japan but whats unique about this one in osaka is its ferris wheel which you can actually take a ride on its rather a gimmicky experience but it does provide a view over dotonbori if you find yourselves with more time in osaka then heres a few more things to do an old neonlit neighborhood south of minami koyasan is the name of a secluded and small temple town nestled away in the mountains of wakayama its more commonly known as the center of japans shingon buddhism and home to over temples in which of them allow for overnight stays we decided to purchase the koyasan world heritage ticket which covers the entire trip to koyasan it takes almost hours to reach koyasan from osaka the cable car ride from gokurakubashi station to koyasan is clearly the highlight of the hour trip after reaching the temple town we check in at our temple lodging named saizenin the rooms are traditional japanese rooms with tatami floors sliding doors and shared bathroom facilities so this is our temple stay for the day and night a lot more luxurious than i imagined the first place to visit was the danjo garan temple complex its one of the first complexes build by kobo daishi and houses around temples and buildings including konpo daito the great pagoda not far from the complex youll find the great daimon gate this was the original entrance to koyasan but also now serves as the end destination for the old choishi michi pilgrimage trail from daimon gate we head to kongobuji the head temple of shingon buddhism in koyasan we explore its many halls and corridors as well as banryutei japans largest rock garden which supposedly should resemble a pair of dragons emerging from a sea of clouds we grab a quick snack from the local convenience store and then decide to head to the main attraction of koyasan okunoin cemetery this misty and mossy cemetery is japans largest stretching over km and is home to over graves its serene and peaceful place and i highly recommend taking an hour or so to simply explore okunoin is also home to the kobo daishi mausoleum this is where kobo daishi is said to be in an eternal meditation there are no photos or video allowed after the bridge so youll just have to visit yourself to see as the evening hours arrive we head back to our temple lodging where were greeted with a traditional buddhist meal the meal itself is strictly vegetarian and resembles of that of the traditional kaisekistyle dinner if you decide to stay at a temple then dont forget to attend the morning ritual to complete the experience next we head to nara a city nestled between osaka and kyoto the city is most known for its park with the very same name and the many deer that roam the surrounding area if youre interested in feeding one or two crackers can be purchased from local vendors around the park the deer will politely thank you for it the first place to visit in nara is the great temple of todaiji it houses the buddha statue nara daibatsu which is the largest bronze statue in the world while exploring the temple we also come across this square hole in a pillar known as buddhas nostril its said to bring good health and luck if you manage to crawl through it as we explore the park further we come across kasugataisha a shinto shrine known for its s of bronze lanterns many of which have been donated by worshippers throughout the years the lanterns are only lit twice a year during two lantern festivals one in february and one in august we decided to get a little bit of exercise and climb mount wakakusa a meters tall hill located in the park just climbing the little hill or mountain heres in nara lisas right behind me its quite a little climb but nothing too tough and well worth the little climb to get an excellent view over the city and the nara park after walking around so much we needed a quick bite and you cant come to nara without witnessing the famous mochipounding show from this small mochi shop the mochi was also excellent for more things to do in nara try the following kyoto the ancient capital of japan home to a number of important temples shrines palaces and gardens the city is therefore a major tourist destination second only to tokyo we board an early morning train to arashiyama an area known for its natural scenery the first place to visit here is the arashiyama bamboo grove right next to the bamboo grove youll find tenryuji one of the most important temples in kyoto as well as having one of the finest gardens in the entire city from tenryuji we walk along the katsura river the main river that runs through arashiyama from there we take a short walk up to the lovely senkoji temple this is arguably a bit of a hidden gem in arashiyama the temple provides a great view as well as the chance to meet the local temple dog one cannot visit arashiyama without coming across the iwatayama monkey park home to over japanese snow monkeys as we finish up with arashiyama we also make a quick stop at kinkakuji currently a temple it was formerly used as a retirement villa for a shogun for dinner we craved a bowl of ramen and one of the best places in kyoto is ramen sen no kaze its quite a wellknown ramen shop so do expect a que during dining hours we start the next day exploring the nishiki market a wellknown food market in kyoto there are over s stalls and shops in nishiki selling local dishes seafood and produce gion is the traditional entertainment district of kyoto and one of the major tourist areas the best way to explore gion is to simply walk the many historic streets such as in addition hanamikoji is a street famous for its tea houses and the place to catch a glimpse of a working geisha the next morning we head to another popular destination the fushimi inari shrine its a shrine dedicated to inari the shinto god of rice and its famous for its s of torii gates as you can see it gets extremely crowded but the further you walk up the lesser the crowds become we heard that temples are usually great places to watch the autumn foliage first up is nanzenji famous for the large aqueduct and the surrounding temple area next door we find eikando temple a famous autumn foliage spot thanks to its pristine garden the last place we visited while in kyoto is the small alley of pontocho famous for its atmospheric dining area filled with restaurants and bars we decided to grab our last meal here and tried some very expensive beef and yes it was definitely worth the price got more time in kyoto well heres a few extras we have to board the jr thunderbird limited express it would take around hours to reach kanazawa this was the perfect opportunity to try out the many bento box train meals which was sold at the various stations across japan kanazawa is often called little kyoto and one can see why since the city has maintained many wellkept historic districts the city is also renown for its gold leaf production being responsible for over of japans output throw in some great art museums and one of the best gardens in the country and kanazawa is quite the hidden gem although most of the main sights are centrally located meaning walking is doable buses are still the main way to get around you can use an ic card on the jr machi bus line but other lines require a local oneday pass or paying for the fare we decided to visit the omicho market since it was close to our hotel the market has a year history dating back to the edo period now its a popular food market with over stalls earning its title the kitchen of kanazawa we opted for a quick lunch at the very popular mori mori sushi a wellknown conveyor belt sushi restaurant residing in the market ordering like many other places in japan is done through a tablet or you can simply grab a dish from the conveyor belt itself kanazawa has plenty of museums but one that caught my attention in particular was the dt suzuki museum the museum was opened to celebrate the life and work of suzuki daisetz teitaro a prominent zen buddhist a more popular museum and one of the big attractions in kanazawa is the st century museum of contemporary art its a much larger museum compared to the dt suzuki and you can easily get lost for hours exploring the many halls and exhibits for dinner we decided to visit a small cozy sushi shop called sushi ippei the restaurant was run by an elderly couple and the elderly woman was especially friendly and attentive explaining any noteworthy sushi pieces this shell fish only in kanazawa only in kanazawa local local shellfish oh okay not in another place ah okay only here only here no soy sauce just eat okay our goal for the following day was to visit the last essential places on our kanazawa todo list we start off visiting the oyama shrine during our visit we were lucky enough to witness a wedding ceremony being held at the shrine from the shrine we toke a short walk up to the kanazawa castle a partially restored castle it was the seat of the powerful maeda clan after walking through the castle grounds we reach the kenroukuen garden the garden is particularly known for these protective ropes which are tied in a cone shape around the trees to provide support when the season shifts to winter its one of the most beautiful gardens in japan and arguably also one of the best places to see the change of seasons also in the garden you can find this small japanese tea house where you can experience a traditional japanese tea ceremony if youre interested right outside the garden you can also find hakuichi who sells the gold leafcovered soft serve being in kanazawa i had no option but to try it higashi chaya is one of three historic tea house districts in kanazawa here geishas used to entertain the wealthy of the city with traditional dancing music and drinking games while many of the buildings have been converted to restaurants and shops its still a place to visit when in kanazawa while researching kanazawa i heard about this place which served a black miso ramen and being a ramen lover myself i just knew i had to give it a try its a small ramen shop specialized in miso ramen you can get the miso in three different flavors and colors i opted for black miso which uses squid ink as we walk back to our hotel the last place we stopped by was at the tsuzumi gate the iconic red gate and unofficial symbol of kanazawa here you can often find live street performances as we experienced during our trip takayama is a small city located in the mountainous hida region of gifu the small city is especially known for its carpentry as well as its famous hida beef and sake due to its location its also a place near many onsen hot spots which was the main reason for our visit we started the day exploring the old town where there was a daily morning market we also visted the takayama jinya an old government building and former headquarters of the hida province we then ended up at sanmachisuji a quaint historic neighborhood filled with traditional merchant houses and sake breweries its the place for trying the citys famous sake if youre interested takayama is often a popular stop on the way on the way to the famous shirakawago if you however dont have the time to visit like us you can instead visit the hida folk village which is an openair museum that display various similar mountain village houses found in shirakawago it was now time for us to our ryokan we toke a bus to okuhida onsen and arrive at our ryokan for the night the ryokan comes with traditional japanese rooms with the option of having your own private onsen as well as access to rooftop onsen before we toke a dip we head down for dinner which was a japanese kaiseki a multicourse meal heading back up to our room after dinner we were pleasantly surprised with the room being prepared for a good nights sleep i know this is a customary thing in a ryokan but still i thought it was nice but instead of calling it a night we head up to the rooftop onsen there are two separate onsens to try and we had it pretty much all to ourselves despite the slight rain and clouds covering the night sky it was still a decent experience next morning we decided to wake up early and enjoy our last moments with our onsen the morning light did a great job in revealing the beautiful landscape that we missed during last night we then headed down for a quick breakfast before checking out before we embark on our long trip to tokyo we decided to visit the shinhotaka ropeway its one of the most popular sightseeing spots in all of gifu the ropeway ascends nearly meters to a mountaintop observatory offering panoramic view of japans northern alps a place im looking forward to revisit on another date we board the shinkansen bullet train and head to our final destination of this trip tokyo skyscrapers bright lights busy and efficient there isnt much to say about tokyo which hasnt already been said its a modern super city packed with sights and activities that would keep any traveler busy for weeks during our time in tokyo we stayed at the tokyo zen capsule hotel while ive stayed at capsule hotels before this place was a bit more unique inspired by traditional japanese rooms each capsule was afforded a lot more space than your regular capsule which made the stay more comfortable the hotel came with the expected amenities so overall it was an enjoyable stay on our first day in tokyo we decided to visit the meiji shrine the entrance is marked by a large torii gate and leads into a forest area where the shrine resides the shrine is dedicated to the deified spirits of emperor meiji and his wife its one of the most popular shrines in japan and welcomes over million visitors a year not far from the shrine youll find harajuku the center of harajuku is takeshita street with its many side streets lined up by trendy shops fashion boutiques and fast food stores all geared towards the trendy youths of tokyo within harajuku we decide to visit a small cafe where the main attraction is spending some time with micro pigs its my first time being in such as cafe but animal centric cafes are very common in tokyo just dont expect too much from the beverage list which to be honest isnt really the point of visiting cafes such as this from mipig cafe we head down to the famous shibuya crossing a popular scramble crossing in shibuya and at peak hours s of pedestrians scramble across what many believe to be the worlds busiest crosswalk to get a better view of the crossing we head up to the mags park building where you can get access to an excellent rooftop view of the crossing below as hunger strikes we dive into the popular sushi chain uobei sushi known for its budget friendly prices and conveyor style system the following day we decide to spend the entire day exploring akihabara tokyos famous electric town its a buzzing commercial area mostly famous for being the center of geek culture in japan anime manga videogames and maid cafes are in full display here whether youre into this or not its still an area worth exploring first try out the many arcades in akihabara bust out your favorite dance moves or maybe win a prize if youre lucky theres also a lot of shopping that can be done here so who knows you might find the perfect sourvenir on our last day in tokyo we decided to visit teamlab borderless a digital art museum with several unique exhibits on display here are some highlights borderless world for its waterfall inspired artwork theres also the crystal world which features thousands upon thousands of colorful led lights the forest of lamps is probably the most popular display here in the borderless museum so do expect long queues i also want to give a quick mention to the en tea house which displays a digital artwork on your tea after teamlab we head to one of many popular and atmospheric alleyways of tokyo omoide yokocho also known as memory lane its a narrow and atmospheric alleyway filled by small eateries paper lanterns fake maple leaves and the grilling smell of yakitori my advice is to explore the many izakayas and try anything that might interest you if you have more time or just looking for different things to do heres a short list the iconic tokyo tower a symbol of japans postwar rebirth the ancient sensoji temple the oldest temple in tokyo kabukicho the famous entertainment district found in shinjuku now this video wouldnt be complete without a full budget breakdown the total cost for two people during this two week trip was around so that was my two week trip to japan i dont think ill ever get tired of visiting this country and i hope things get better around the world soon so we can all travel again but more importantly i hope this video was helpful or at least gave some inspiration if youre planning a trip to japan yourself but if you have any questions or feedback then do leave them in the comments below and ill try to get back to you but until then stay safe out there and heres hoping for a better year ahead
ODuEl4oNae0,traveling to the least visited country in the world,music what do you think the least visited country in the world is well after a quick google search it turns out that neither myself nor most people on the street had ever even heard of this extremely tiny country in the south pacific called tuvalu have you sounds like a disease yeah the uh artist oh is it a surfing spot oh yeah and while trying to figure out where this country is located it was actually hard to even spot it on a map thats because the entire countrys landmass is only twice the size of the la airport or even just a fourth of the size of disney world tuvalu has about residents and is sadly one of the first countries to be forecasted to disappear as a result of rising oceans caused by climate change since the day i found out about this country i havent been able to stop thinking about it wondering what the people are like what there is to do in a country without any tourism infrastructure and wanting to go tell a story about this country that could possibly disappear very soon so he got me a plane to get to the least visited country in the world and a few days away from my departure i wasnt too happy about the setup for the trip bye thomas can someone tell me why im going alone i think youve just been too comfortable and your girlfriend has traveled to every country including this one so if youre too afraid to do it alone then clearly we should replace you with your girlfriend ive heard that theres no like service really and i also read just now everything on the island is cash only and theres no atm on the island so like how do people get money i dont even know what language these people speak do you know what language they speak to to luann to the language to volume and english that is the most uniquely shaped island ive ever seen is that water in the middle yeah wow yeah what do you mean are you sure how do you not know this music bye music not many music just a quick stop in fiji and the domestic airport its pretty small sporting flight number two music music thank you thank you all right this is it looks like weve officially landed in suvalu the white roof yeah thats snow right there thank you appreciate it nice to meet you too at first thought oh wow theres a lot more people coming to visit tulu than i thought when i boarded the plane and then as i slowly started to have a conversation with all these people every single one of them is here to work with the un not here for tourism so looks like i might be the only one lets go see what this hotel is all about is this the reception yes what is your name thomas bragg hi where am i here okay all right this is pretty nice there goes the only plane in the entire country leaves now and doesnt come back for another three days well everybody that seems to find out that im here for visiting seems pretty confused even the people working here immigration lady she asked me so why are you here sir and i said oh for fun she looked at me she goes for fun the swedish boy is here to explore should probably get dressed to fit the colors of the island a little bit better all right this is a whole lot better time to head out is there anywhere i can rent a bike oh we have one bike oh you have a bike here okay great music wow the ocean water is so clear what the hell was high im moving to two im staying here boys sorry music music music music this country is so thin you can literally see both sides of the water pretty much at any point so you see theres the lagoon and then theres the open water right here pretty much every single person that i have crossed so far walking is waving and saying hi already just first impressions like love this place are there a lot of tourists here hey are you yeah just came today yeah was that funny to you how did you get how did i find tuvalu yeah i googled whats the least visited country in the world and then i found tuvalu and so i was like i have to go and see it ive been on this island for about four hours now and i still havent seen a single other tourist half a chicken wow thank you it is sunset time which means the locals have taken over the airstrip and turned it into their soccer field their volleyball field and all sorts of different activities going on right now i think ive spotted my first tourists on the entire island hi im thomas thomas im sarah good to meet you sir im sweaty thats all good thomas sure on our team which is this lets thing music why are you here im half to bala you have tavalo yeah wow and then half what half australia wow ive joined a little local soccer game right now turns out that the australian guys that i saw here are half to volume as well what is it to do during the day i think the best thing you probably do is try to get out to the other islands ah my new australian tavalon friends later invited me to go have dinner with them have you guys ordered already yes they then invited me over to their grandparents house where some of their family still lives and explained to me a bit more what growing up on the island was like can people sleep on this yes correct theres mattresses but most of us prefer the mat so crazy to imagine that you grew up here for how long which how much of your life on and off till i was about here wow tabala was the language i thought and spoken it took a long time to get used to mattresses are you serious how many people live in this house nine but then we have like visitors everywhere the boys out there they like to come and hang out here quite a fair bit so sometimes they just pass out wherever they want theres sort of no boundaries you live here i live here its just oh wow that wraps up day one in tuvalu seeing how communal they all live together was was awesome see how tomorrow goes good night okay time to go watch the development where we going come on guys lets go we have arrived at the sunrise spot music music okay were about to go check out a local bakery slash market lets go see what fresh tavalin bakeries look like oh my god that looks amazing music did we just arrive in heaven or what what is this place we have the jackpot hell yeah oh

of tavalu take their communal living just everybody shares right theres food thats just made and everybody can come and just and eat and stay here yeah wow this local ended up explaining to me something really interesting about tavalu that at some point along your upbringing you can end up calling one of your best friends your brother or your sister and at that point that person literally becomes a part of your family when you both grow up to have kids with your separate partners you then all move in together in interconnected houses and raise all the kids as a community and so did you have a friend growing up that you called your brother and then he became your brother you have that wow i went home that night feeling grateful and amazed by everything i just learned music whats up

community radiate from an entire country from the moment i landed in tuvalu to the moment i stepped back onto that plane people were nothing but smiling welcoming and kind i came as a stranger for only a few days and left feeling like id been adopted by this incredible and loving family i feel grateful to have met our local yes fam representative and for having had the opportunity to feel connected to people living so far away and living such different lives as i was walking out the door the lady at the hotel asked me if id ever come back and i usually just politely answer of course in these situations but this time i think i meant it music
nxG_OXFo3JU,english podcast is traveling good for young people english on the go intermediate,music hey there and welcome back to english on the go your goto podcast for learning english in a fun and practical way todays episode is all about something many young people dream of traveling were diving into the question is traveling good for young people whether its for exploring new places learning about different cultures or even just taking a break from everyday life travel seems to offer a lot but is it always the best choice in todays discussion well explore the benefits and challenges young people face when traveling stick around because theres plenty to unpack and learn from all right so lets dig a little deeper into todays topic traveling as a young person we all know that traveling offers a chance to see the world meet new people and gain experiences that just cant find in the classroom or at home but for young people it can mean even more it can help with personal growth learning independence and building new perspectives however its not all smooth sailing theres the cost safety concerns and the question of whether its better to focus on studies or work first in todays conversation well hear from two friends who have very different views on whether traveling is beneficial for young people before we start ask yourself do you think travel is essential for your development or is it something that can wait before we jump into the conversation id like you to take a moment to think about these questions remember there are no right or wrong answers its all about your opinion and experiences first have you ever traveled to a new place if so how did it change you second do you think traveling at a young age can really help shapee a persons future or is it just a fun experience take a moment to reflect on these ideas as you listen to the conversation think about how the views of our characters align with your own thoughts on the topic all right in todays conversation we have two friends lisa and mark talking about whether traveling is beneficial for young people lisa believes that travel is an essential part of growing up while mark thinks there are other priorities to focus on lets listen to what they have to say i just got back from my trip to italy and let me tell you mark it was an eyeopener i feel like ive grown so much just from experiencing a new culture it really broadened my horizons im glad you had a good time lisa but do you really think traveling is that big of a deal i mean sure you get to see new places but is it really necessary especially when youre young shouldnt we we focus more on studying or building a career first i get your point but traveling doesnt mean youre not being productive its not just about ticking places off a list when you travel youre stepping out of your comfort zone you learn how to deal with different situations meet people from all walks of life and it forces you to become more independent its like gaining life skills you cant pick up from a textbook plus experiencing different cultures can really open your mind in ways you wouldnt expect its not just about the places its about the people the customs even the way of thinking you come back with a new perspective i guess theres some truth to that but its expensive most young people cant afford to travel without breaking the bank and lets face it not everyone has the luxury of dropping everything and taking off dont you think its more practical to save money work hard and build a stable life first true travel does cost money but it doesnt always have to be about expensive trips there are ways to travel on a budget like staying in hosts backpacking or even working parttime while traveling have you ever heard of programs like work away or volunteering abroad you can actually work while you explore new places which helps keep the costs down and honestly i think of it as an investment in myself the experiences ive gained are priceless whether its learning a new language making connections or just getting out of my bubble its like the return on investment shows up in ways you cant predict yeah but what if something goes wrong while youre traveling like traveling alone and you run into a difficult situation i mean doesnt that stress you out theres so much uncertainty and what if you end up stuck in a foreign country thats actually part of the adventure dealing with the unexpected is how you grow sure things dont always go as planned but thats where the real learning happens you learn how to problem solve on the go and honestly those moments are often the most memorable for example i got lost in rome one night my phone died i didnt speak much italian and at first i panicked but then i figured it out asked for directions and ended up having the best conversation with a local who walked me back to my hotel thats the kind of experience that teaches you resilience every problem you solve makes you stronger and more adaptable i think those challenges are what make traveling so valuable i see where youre coming from but i still think its not for everyone some people would rather focus on building their future first and traveling later when theyre more financially secure or when theyve settled down dont you think theres some value in waiting until the right moment i hear you mark but the thing is life is unpredictable if we always wait for the perfect time it might never come and while theres nothing wrong with focusing on building your career traveling while youre young gives you a different perspective on the world it can shape your future in ways you didnt expect i mean you can find inspiration for your career or business ideas from the places you visit or even meet people who could help you in the future you dont have to put your life on hold to travel and its about balance really you can build your career and travel at the same time even if its just small trips in between jobs or study breaks fair point i guess it does come down to personal preference its just hard to see myself dropping everything to go travel right now maybe ill take the plunge and try it out one day who knows you should once you start you might not want to stop trust me its a gamechanger and it doesnt have to be a grand trip around the world even exploring nearby countries or just visiting a new city can give you that sense of adventure you never know how itll impact you until you experience it yeah maybe a short trip would be a good way to start ill think about it it sounds like it really changed your perspective it did and youll be surprised at how much you learn about yourself along the way you discover strengths you didnt know you had and you get a clear idea of what you want in life plus the memories you make are worth every penny all right youve convinced me to at least consider it maybe next year ill start planning something just a short trip like you said i could use a break from the daily grind anyway thats the spirit start small and who knows you might catch the travel bug and never look back just remember to enjoy the journey and keep an open mind the world has so much to offer in todays conversation lisa and mark used some interesting vocabulary phrasal verbs idioms and life related phrases that are useful for talking about travel and life experiences lets dive into a few of them first off lisa says her trip to italy was an eye opener now when we call something an eyeopener it means it gave us a new perspective or taught us something surprising lisa found the experience very insightful for example visiting different countries is always an eyeopener it makes you realize how diverse the world is then lisa me mentions that traveling broadened her horizons this idiom means it expanded her knowledge or understanding traveling allows you to see things you wouldnt experience otherwise so its a great way to broaden your horizons for instance reading books is good but traveling really broadens your horizons now mark brings up the issue of breaking the bank this idiom means spending a lot of money more than you can afford hes worried about the cost of traveling and he doesnt want to break the bank if youre not careful dining out all the time can really break the bank later in the conversation lisa talks about stepping out of your comfort zone this is a common phrase we use when talking about doing something that feels uncomfortable or unfamiliar but helps you grow lisa feels that traveling forces her to step out of her comfort zone starting a new job can push you out of your comfort zone but its often worth it finally lisa ws it up by saying travel is a gamechanger a gamechanger is something that completely changes the way you think or approach something learning english was a real game cher for my career i just got back from my trip to italy and let me tell you mark it was an eye opener i feel like ive grown so much just from experiencing a new culture it really broadened my horizons im glad you had a good time lisa but do you really think traveling is that big of a deal i mean sure

lrvD3NS-tA8,athens and sidetrips,hi im rick steves back with more of the best of europe this time its all greek to me and thats exactly why were here its athens thanks for joining us about five centuries before christ athens was the center of the western world at a time when rome was just a village it was here that the foundations of our western civilization were laid and today in the midst of all this rich heritage the vibrant capital of greece still thrives well enjoy the magnificence of ancient athens marvel at the wonders of the acropolis savor some tasty greek street food and check out the premier collection of ancient greek art then well poke around the plaka before escaping the big city to consult an ancient oracle and relax on a classic greek isle in the extreme south of europe is greece its capital is athens from there we sidetrip to the oracle of delphi then cruise from athens port of piraeus to the island of hydra well start up there at the historic cultural and literal high point of any trip to athens the acropolis like other hilltop sites in the ancient greek world athens acropolis or high city was both a place of worship and of refuge when under attack crowned by the mighty parthenon temple the acropolis rises above modern athens a lasting testament to greeces glorious golden age in the th century bc grand processions followed the panathenaic way which was a ceremonial path connecting the town below and the acropolis theyd pass through this imposing entryway and up to the religious heart of the city in the parthenon the parthenon was perhaps the finest temple in the ancient world valiantly battling the acidic air of our modern world it still stands with the help of ongoing restoration work it was constructed in the th century bc and dedicated to the virgin goddess athena seeing it today is aweinspiring but imagine how striking it must have looked when it was completed nearly years ago in all its carved and brilliantly painted splendor the adjacent erect is famous for its porch of the caryatids six beautiful maidens functioning as columns dedicated to athena and poseidon this was one of the most important religious buildings on the acropolis this rather than the parthenon was the culmination of the panathenaic procession at the foot of the acropolis the ancient agora or marketplace sprawls out from its surviving temple this is where for years athenians gathered while the acropolis was the center of ritual and ceremony the agora was the beating heart of ancient athens for some years starting in the th century bc this was the hub of commercial political and social life visitors wander the remains of what was the citys principal shopping mall and administrative center exploring the agora its fascinating to ponder the world of plato and aristotle and the age which laid the foundations for western thinking about economics democracy logic and more the stoa of attalos from the nd century bc was rebuilt in modern times to house the agoras museum with so little of the agora still standing this reconstruction makes it easier to imagine the site in its original glory crowds would gather in shady porticos like this to shop socialize or listen to the great philosophers of the age in fact socrates spent much of his life right here preaching the virtues of nothing in excess and urging those around him to know thyself the temple of hephaestus one of the best preserved and most typical of all greek temples dates from about bc like the parthenon its constructed in the simple doric style it housed big bronze statues of hephaestus the blacksmith god and athena patroness of the city greek architecture evolved in stages the capitals or tops of the columns were both functional and decorative while just the tip of the architectural iceberg these are handy indicators helping us identify the three main architectural orders or styles the earliest style doric has flat practical plates as capitals in the next order ionic the capitals are decorated with understated scrolls the final order corinthian popular later on with the romans features leafy capitals boldly decorative with no apologies necessary how to remember all these as the orders evolve they gain syllables doric ionic corinthian but for most travelers the agora is more than an architectural review strolling in the footsteps of socrates is your best opportunity to commune with the epic greek past like so many great civilizations ancient greece peaked and then faded years ago athens was just a small town surrounded by big ruins sitting on lots of history that thcentury athens is todays plaka the plaka district provides tourists with a more intimate athens no chaotic traffic lots of colorful restaurants and the best souvenir shopping in all of greece and for a quick inexpensive bite to eat drop by a corner gyro and souvlaki stand gyro means turning referring to the slowly spinning round of meat roasted pork or chicken shaved as needed and souvlaki is meat on a skewer shish kebab style my favorite a gyro pita slice up that meat toss in a little salad tsatsiki a garlic yogurt sauce and spices all wrapped in a handy cone of toasted pita bread energized by a tasty gyro hike to the top of the plaka and explore the charming village of anafiotika literally little anafi it was built in the th century by people from the tiny cycladic island of anafi they came here to the big city looking for work in this oasis of tranquility nestled beneath the walls of the acropolis the intensity of athens seems miles away weave through narrow paths lined with flowers and dotted with cats dozing in the sunshine observe the peaceful rhythm of daily life and with a little luck you can make a friend and be invited in or in this case up onto the roof for a pleasant chat and a cup of strong greek coffee bell ringing athens is getting more and more peoplefriendly this elegant walkway is a popular pedestrian boulevard arcing around the back of the acropolis as the sun goes down its busy with locals and visitors alike at the end of the walk prime acropolisview real estate is dedicated to the fine art of cafesitting sipping a drink here puts you right in the middle of a lively greek scene in athens it seems all roads pass through syntagma square today people pour out of the citys busiest subway station into this cafefilled square shady trees make it a breezy and restful spot years ago athens was just a humble town of about huddled at the base of the acropolis but when the greeks won their independence from the ottoman turks in the early s they chose little but historic athens to be their capital this stately square was part of a grand project designed to turn the town into a suitable capital for the new nation the original square was essentially a big front yard for the new royal palace the countrys leading families built mansions here to be close to the king these mansions survive today as grand old hotels embassies and museums in a riotous crowd jammed this square demanding a syntagma or constitution the king gave a speech from this balcony granting his people whose ancestors invented the concept democracy this place has been known as constitution square or syntagma square ever since today the royal palace houses the greek parliament the palace and the tomb of the unknown warrior are guarded by the muchphotographed evzones these flamboyant soldiers with their distinctive strut change at the top of each hour theyre clad in the traditional pleated kilt and pompom shoes made famous by the evzones these mountain fighters battled ferociously in greeces earlythcentury war of independence they claim the soldiers outfits have pleats one for each miserable year of turkish occupation and dont you forget it buoyant after winning freedom from its turkish overlords the new capital city flourished some of those first government buildings built in the prevailing neoclassical style still survive today they stand amid todays bustling metropolis in the th century with an influx of refugees and industrialization luring workers in from the countryside the population of athens exploded the flow of people into the sprawling city continues and million people roughly one out of every three greeks call athens home and recently the city has curbed pollution cleaned up and pedestrianized the streets spiffed up the museums and invested in one of europes better public transit systems descend into athens sleek and cool underground and youll enjoy a transit system as efficient as anything in europe with all its traffic congestion above and nearly a million athenians zipping smoothly underground every day the system is a godsend ermou street leading away from syntagma is a thriving pedestrian mall just a few years ago this street was a carclogged mess once again when it was first pedestrianized merchants were upset now its a hit with everyone the one mustsee site outside the central tourist zone is the national archaeological museum this extraordinary collection lets you follow the sweep of greek art history from bc to ad a trove of funerary art from the royal tombs of mycenae shows treasures from a society that thrived around years before the days of socrates and plato youll see finely decorated weapons and sheaths exquisite golden jewelry and the delicate vaphio gold cups reminders of the sophistication of that thcentury bc civilization this warrior vase from the th century bc shows women gathered to wave goodbye to a group of warriors heading off to war sporting fancy armor with duffel bags hanging from their spears these mycenaean soldiers with their yellowribbon moms are a timeless offtowar scene repeated every generation in the years since ancient greeks celebrated the human body to them it was the embodiment of the order found in nature all the parts were there in geometrical if not biological perfection no individual features everything was idealized in fact these archaic statues were named simply kourous meaning boy or kore meaning girl statues from this age around bc all had the same standard features weight spread evenly on two feet arms rigid at the side stiff braided hair almondshaped eyes high eyebrows and the same quirky little grins archaic statues all look like cousins during the archaic period all the parts were there but if it decided to walk it would walk like a monster stiffly with no understanding of the subtle interplay between hips and shoulders but greek art evolved with its society the year period from about to bc was known as the golden age of greece the age of socrates and pericles and athens was the center during this time the golden mean was nothing in excess in both life and art everything was to be in balance golden age sculptors shifted weight more believably placing their statues in a contrapposto pose that means relaxed with hips shifted realistically and weight resting on one foot statues looked more lifelike ancient greek treasures include the poseidon of artemision this stunning bronze statue cast in bc depicts the mighty god of the sea about to hurl his trident once again we see that classic greek balance between stillness and motion but in around bc athens was conquered by the macedonians from the north subjugation by the macedonians under philip ii and his son alexander the great ushered in whats known as the hellenistic period the word hellenistic refers to greek culture after its political conquest greek hellenistic art like greek hellenistic society in general evolved beyond the aesthetics of the golden age while less balanced and composed it was a more individualistic age with more exuberant and emotional art the horse and jockey of artemision cast in the second century bc is filled with this hellenistic energy the highspirited detail is astonishing right down to the horses dramatic head and the concerned look on the young jockeys face the evolution of greek art from stiff to realistic to emotional would be echoed by europe years later from stiff gothic to realistic renaissance to emotional baroque a twohour drive northwest of athens takes us to delphi one of the most important sites in the ancient world wherever you travel seeing the precious artifacts in the big city museums first helps you better appreciate the historic sites out in the countryside ancient delphi perched high on the slopes of mount parnassos was not a city it was the site of the oracle of apollo god of the sun people would journey here from all over the known world to seek wisdom from the gods on vital affairs of state today tourists zigzag up the ancient sacred way to the temple of apollo the path is flanked by the remains of delphis famous treasuries monuments erected by citystates in gratitude for the oracles advice local guides like penny kolomvotsou bring these ancient and mythic events to life so tell me why this place was chosen for the oracle zeus wanted to know where the center of the world was he let two eagles fly from the two opposite ends of the universe and this is where they met here in delphi so he called this basically the bellybutton of the world yeah the omphalos yeah this wonderful place became the center of the world steves the resulting sanctuary of apollo reached the height of its power between the th and the th centuries bc the oracle became so influential that no great leader would make a major decision without first sending emissaries to consult the oracle penny there was a priestess inside the temple and right underneath it there was this room where she was inhaling vapors evaporating from the ground so she was in trance so she would babble and the priests would say this is wisdom from the gods exactly steves because the priests debriefed those seeking advice on the state of their homelands delphi became the database of the ancient world because of that the priests here were actually able to astound those who came with their wise believably divine advice and there was more to delphi than just the oracle so people from all over the greekspeaking world came here correct and apart from coming here to consult the oracle the other reason was also because like in olympia they had the olympic games here in delphi we had the pythian games yeah these were competitions concerning music poetry sport events as well so a balance of things music and sports yeah everything in moderation know thyself the golden mean in everything so weve got the theater weve got the stadium steves during those panhellenic or allgreek festivals delphi filled its theater which seated and it packed as many as sports fans into its stadium i like being here at the end of the day with the tourists gone cheers of the longgone crowd still ringing in the cool mountain air and the starting block all mine starting gun fires as it was in ancient times piraeus is still the port of athens from piraeus boats depart for points throughout the aegean sea cruise ships await their passengers and hydrofoils vie with lumbering car ferries its an exciting springboard for the greek isles were riding a flying dolphin one of the fleet of speedy hydrofoils that zip from athens to the islands and from island to island its fast but less scenic as the passengers are stuck inside i like to hang out in the windy doorway after a minute ride athens is a world away and we pull into the isle of hydra its main town also called hydra is home to about of the islands residents after the noise of athens hydras trafficfree tranquility is a delight im glad im packing light as i hike up to my hotel hydra is one of the prettiest towns in greece its superb harbor is surrounded by an amphitheater of rocky hills theres an easy blend of workaday commerce fancy yachts and lazy tourists on island time donkeys rather than cars the shady awnings of wellworn cafes and memorable seaside views all combine to make it clear youve found your greek isle hydra was a greek naval power famous for its shipbuilders the harbor with twin ports and plenty of cannon housed and protected the fleet of ships as the greeks battled the turks in their early thcentury war of independence the town stretches away from the harbor a maze of narrow cobbled streets flanked by whitewashed homes in the s the island became a favorite retreat for artists and writers who still draw inspiration from its idyllic surroundings one of the islands greatest attractions is its total absence of cars and motorbikes instead donkeys do the heavy hauling today just as they have through the centuries and i suppose for just as long theyve treated children to rides as well at the top of the town the humble taverna leonidas has been around so long it doesnt need a sign the islands oldest and most traditional taverna was the hangout of the local sponge divers a century ago these days leonidas and panagiota feed guests as if theyre family and tonight the place is all ours as our enthusiastic cook welcomes us into his kitchen so what are we cooking cook lamb with roast potatoes grilled shrimps with an oil lemon sauce calamari with a garlic sauce very good spanakopita spinach pie eggplant and then beets steves and before we know it leonidas has us all sitting at the table and he starts bringing in wave after wave of his fabulous dishes here we go the shrimp grilled shrimps with the oil lemon sauce a fleet of taxis shuttle people to outlying hamlets and beaches were catching one for a windy survey of the island and to be dropped off for a scenic hike back into town hydra is popular with walkers who come to explore the network of ancient paths that link the islands outlying settlements churches and monasteries and in springtime hikes come with fields of wildflowers a delightful way to cap the day is to follow the coastal path to the village of kaminia its pocketsized harbor shelters the communitys fishing boats here with a glass of ouzo and todays catch as the sun slowly sinks into the sea and boats become silhouettes you drink to the beauties of a greek island escape perhaps nowhere else does the historic and cultural timeline of europe reach so far back while being so vibrant today i hope youve enjoyed our look at athens the oracle of delphi and the romantic isle of hydra im rick steves until next time keep on travelin anto

2-BU2pbIjho,history lovers guide to london best tourist attractions in london top things to do in london,hi history lovers i have something a little different for you this week as i give you my list of the top things to do in london if youre a history buff like me and want to spend your holidays coming as close to time traveling as you can this list would require at least a fortnite to complete which i realize most people wont have so my advice if youre planning to visit london is to watch the video and just cherrypick the things which appeal to you the most and which you can fit into the time you have available and your budget speaking of budgets ive included a mix of paid and free options and ill also be giving you a little tip at the end about how you can get very cheap central london accommodation depending on what time of year youre there and save some money on ticket prices for certain attractions the suggestions are in no particular order but i have tried to group things together that you can do in one day andor which go well together if you stay till the end ill also give you not one but two bonus suggestions for things which arent in london but which are close enough to do in a day trip and well worth a visit finally even if youre not planning on visiting englands capital city anytime soon i think youll enjoy this video anyway as a way to travel vicariously through your screen disclaimer time obviously what follows is just my opinion and based on information available to me at the time of creating the video so you should check things like prices and opening times before you travel i have listed web websites for the attractions mentioned in the description box but again you should look at these sites yourselves and make sure youre happy with them before you part with any money i wont be sharing prices here as they change so often that the video would become outdated very quickly if i did okay then lets get stuck music in number one the tar of london this is of course a must for any history lover coming to london assuming you can suck up the heavy ticket price it is an all day affair seriously allow a good hours for it maybe even six if youre determined to see everything and enjoy visiting things like the cron jeels of the united kingdom the execution site and final resting place of the likes of anne bin katherine howard and lady jan gray which is actually where youll be queuing up to get in to see the cron jews by the way the building in which the princes in the tower were last held and much more my top tips for going to the tower are to get there at opening time as it fills up very fast and go straight to the crown jewels as the cues for these can become horrendous later on in the day if you want to get into the chapel of st peter advincula where anne catherine and gian etc are buried make sure too that you check its opening times as its closed sometimes for things like services and other events and you dont want to be disappointed the be feeders tours which you can do are great fun but i also advise that you take some of what they say with a pinch of salt mine told us that anbin was executed on the green in front of the chapel for example where the glass pillow memorial is but that isnt true number two tar bridge and by the way if you hear me oscillating between saying tar and tower its because tar is how we said in northern land but i sometimes say tower because i get grief from people whining about my accent when i say it my way its hard to remember to switch to an american accent for just that one word though and so youll quite often hear me not just in this video sliding between the two and its just not worth the hassle of rerecording sections for that so you might hear both okay situated right next to the tar this is a marvel of victorian engineering and at the very least i recommend you take a walk across it which is of course free but did you know that you can also pay to go inside the bridge well you can and i have and while its a fairly short activity taking only around an hour and a quarter its quite the experience the bridge has glass floors which allow you to walk over the top of traffic and pedestrians below plus short videos playing within the bridgewalk and in the tars at either end to tell you about the history of the structure this is a great little filler activity if you want to put in some time at the start start or end of your day and tickets can be bought online ahead of time if you wish number three hms belfast this is something else which is basically right next to the tar of london albeit on the other side of tar bridge a battleship built back in the s and which was decommissioned in the early s i couldnt believe that i somehow hadnt done this attraction until recently after all its named after my countrys capital city i spent over hours on this boat which is far bigger than you would think as many of the rooms are below the waterline and i loved it rare for me as i wouldnt say im big into naval history its a great snapshot of life on board ship and you can use the audio guide to traverse it at your own pce youll see where the men and they were all men at slept played and recuperated from illness and injury you can visit the torpedo bay too plus the captains bridge and if like me you can even get lost for to minutes in the engine and boiler rooms when youre desperate for the l there are ls on board by the way plus a small cafe and the gift shop is on shore there are a lot of narrow staircases and even ladders to be negociated here though so do bear that in mind the ship was built to be functional not particularly comfortable and that hasnt changed now that its a fluting museum number four the houses of parliament youll need to book tickets ahead of time for this and arrive early to allow for security you cant take pictures inside the building except in the stunning medieval westminster hall which is where youll start your tour from make sure to look at its floor while youre there to see the plaques which mark places where different royals lay in state after death and where charles i was tried the tour of the palace itself is amazing the artwork on the walls is gorgeous and you learn all about the history of the building and of parliament itself if you visit when parliament isnt in session you can even get into the chambers i sat just a couple of rows behind the pm seat for instance no need to fear if parliament is in session though once your tour is over you can go back sit in the galleries and watch the debates which i did recently some of the lords were fast asleep by the way which i thought was insane as they get paid to be there you might have a small delay before you can do this though as there is liit mited seating in the visitors galleries and youll need to wait for someone to leave to free up a spot for you school parties also take priority so you might get bumped down the queue for them that happened to me and it was annoying there is a nice if moderately small restaurant and gift shop leading off westminster hall plus toilets assuming the hall and the main tour are all youre doing this is a two and a half hour long jaun plus minutes for security at the start though hopefully it wont take that long but it could take that long there is an extra thing you can do though which will add another minutes to your time at westminster and that is a tour of the elizabeth tower which houses the famous big benan i did this recently and it was fantastic but i have to warn you that booking tickets for it is like trying to get tickets for a taylor swift concert not that ive ever done that cuz shes never played belfast but this is what i imagine it would be like they go on sale on a particular day each month at am check their website for uptodate details and they sell out in seconds not minutes seconds this is because they can only have i think people per tour myself and my friend actually rearranged the whole timing of our trip in order to accommodate the only day and time slot we could get which still had two tickets available for the tour if you are lucky enough to get one there are no photographs allied in fact youll leave all your belongings in a locker in a little room off westminster hall and there are hundreds of stairs to climb so this isnt for you if you cant manage that i would equate it to going up inside the dome in st pauls cathedral or maybe inside the statue of liberty if youve ever done that the guide i got who was called david by the way was so good and so knowledgeable and the tour was a joy we got to watch the actual bell bong on the r we were provided with earplugs before it happened and stand directly behind the faces you see when you look up at the tower from outside he also told us an enormous amount about the the history of the tower and the bell if youre able to get tickets for this and i should warn you that they arent cheap then i think youll really enjoy it number five westminster abbey situated right next door to the houses of parliament you could just about do both in a day if you wanted which is why im listing them back to back ive been here several times and i always love it i judge aby cathedrals and churches on how famous and numerous their dead people are and westmin does not disappoint it has a huge number of royal burials including elizabeth the mary the edward i their grandparents henry iith and elizabeth of york plus lady margaret bford an of cleaves more medieval monarchs than i can list and of course poets corner where youll find the likes of jeffrey chaer and charles dickens lots of stewarts and han arians are there too though most of them do not have grand tbs the exception being mary queen of scots and many just have floor plaques which youll need to watch out for so that you dont miss them you can also see the beautiful costi pavement where the altar is and which shell recognize from footage of the prince and princess of wheelss wedding back in a at least hours to do the abby justice you can eat while youre there in their crypt cafe which i have always found to do really nice food number six the church hill war rooms again these are extremely close close to the abbey and parliament and thats why im grouping them together with those locations you could do two of them on the same day though i personally think it would be a bit much and lead to you rushing things the church hill war rooms are the large underground bunker from which winston churchill largely ran the second world war and they are now a museum which recounts the history of the rooms themselves and the war more generally there is a great audio guide which allows you to move around at your own pece and underground cafe fairly small but the novelty here is really about where youre eating and even the original door of number darning street plus original letters photographs and items of clothing from winstons life you can i believe just rock up and buy tickets at the entrance but i purchased mine ahead of time so that i didnt have to queue for as long number seven st pauls cathedral this late th century cathedral was built to replace the one which burnt down in the great fire of london in and was designed by christopher ram it is gorgeous to look at though its well hidden from view on most sides by lader buildings and includes memorials and grave sites for yet more famous people such as florence nightingale to give just one example you can now visit the famous whispering gallery again after it was shut for several years due to health and safety concerns and while youre up there why not your own health aying carry on up inside the dome to the very top for some amazing if sometimes blustery views of london be warned though that if you do decide to ascend to the top of the dome its hundreds of stairs and involves climbing up some very tight spiral staircases youll need to be fairly fit to do this and you also need a decent head for heights as the viewing platform at the top is very narrow its surrounding wall is not that high maybe a little above my waist and its a long way down i would allow a couple of ours for st pauls and i actually did it on the same day that i did westminster aby though my feet did really hurt by the end of it and i would have liked to have spent an extra hour at the aby but we were meeting friends at st paul so i had to leave so maybe dont try to do them in the same day you can but i wouldnt particularly advise it having done it myself number eight the globe theater here history meets literature as you can visit the globe not only for a guided tour telling you about the institutions past and its connections to william shakespeare and elizabeth in england but also to watch one of the bards plays it is open air and while theres some roofing over the audience i wouldnt recommend this if the weather is hiling be aware too please that the current globe is not the original building which is long gone and actually sat on a different site a few yards away instead what you see now is a reconstruction opened in its just on the river from st pauls cathedral so could be done on the same day if you wished number nine buckingham palace this is actually a threeinone recommendation as you can buy one ticket which will get you into the kings gallery formerly the queens gallery the royal muse and if youre visiting during the summer when theyre open the state apartments inside the palace alternatively you can buy individual tickets if you dont want to see it all just check their website and see what suits you best the kings gallery is an art gallery on the left hand side of buckingham palace as you look at its front entrance and it runs exhibitions during most of the year showcasing art photographs and material objects from the royal collection this is where i saw princess charlottes wedding dress for example depending on how long you want to look at each item for this can take about minutes bear in mind it was minutes for me because i was photographing everything like crazy but other people could probably do it faster the amazing thing about this gallery though is the fact that they do allow you to photograph the artworks at all in most of the royal residences where these works live the rest of the time photography is not allowed ive seen these two portraits of edward v and elizabeth the on the walls of windsor castle a couple of times for instance but i was never able to photograph them until they were in the kings gallery now for the royal muse this is where the royal roal cars carriages and horses are kept im not terribly interested in travel history she said in the middle of a travel guide video so this was my least favorite of the three venues but it does include the gold state coach which i did really enjoy seeing and ended up making a whole video on so it was worth it in the end and it only took an hour or so again partly because i was photographing everything in sight finally we have the big daddy of this visit the state apartments of buckingham palace be warned that you cant photograph anything in here but youll understand why if you visit its so full of tourists that if everyone was allowed to stop and take pictures the entire place would grind to a halt its absolutely stunning youll not see this much gold leaf outside of somewhere like versailles in france and a fantastic thing to see if youre looking to treat yourself at the time of creating this video it has recently been announced that more of the palace is going to be opened up so that tourists can see the famous b bony from the inside that is but as that option wasnt available when i was there in i cant tell you anything more about it once youre done with your selfguided tour there is an audio guide i think youll exit out into the palaces back garden where the famous garden parties take place there youll find a smallish restaurant toilets and a gift shop there arent any l which you can access inside the palace so make sure you go before you enter youll pop back out onto the main street by first walking through part of the gardens which are lovely and worth a look in their own right though youre only allowed into a portion of them allin i would allow at least hours for the state departments experience perhaps more anno than another range of the palaces being opened up i do have a few additional tips for you as well if you opt to do this palace day first if you get all three tickets which come in a bundle and are referred to as the royal day out package on the website then youll have timed entry to each thing so watch that you dont miss your slot second be prepared for airport style security at each location and allow extra time for that at least minutes especially for the state apartments which will likely have the worst cues in my experience but check the website and see if it advises any more than that third this is an expensive undertaking and probably a once in alifetime experience unless you visit twice during a calendar year in that case make sure you get each of your three tickets stamped during your first visit so that they become oneyear passes and then you can get back into any one of these sites within the next months for free although you do have to ring up in order to book your tickets i remember having to do that remember to the state rooms are only open for a few weeks in the summer so youll need to time your two trips very carefully to be able to reuse that part of your ticket i reused my kings gallery ticket though and so got to see a second exhibition months after the first at no additional cost i could have done the muse again too but i wasnt interested number kensington palace situated about an hours walk away from buckingham palace kensington palace is the former home of the likes of queen victoria and diana princess of wales the palace is also still used as a home by current royals but of course course you wont get to see those parts of it instead youll see where primarily the han varians lived including the room in which victoria was born and another where she held her first ccil meeting after becoming queen you can take pictures inside which is amazing theres some really great art on the walls and theres a nice cafe and gift shop at the end of the selfguided audio tour the gardens are also lovely and include the famous or perhaps infamous as it wasnt terribly popular from what i remember statue of diana with two children allly at least a couple of hours for your visit number the royal parks london has some incredible parks officially called the royal parks that you can visit for free and several are very close to some of the attractions ive just described to you so you could do one after the other given their association with the royal family and how old they are i decided i could get away with listing them in a history lovers guide st jamess park is directly in front of buckingham palace it includes a leake places to eat and even pelicans then theres green park on the other side of the palace ive walked through here a couple of times on my way from the chbe station to the palace or hide park which is the one youll need to traverse in order to get from buckingham palace to kensington palace thats assuming that youre walking and it runs into kensington gardens it also has a huge lake places to stop and includes the diana memorial garden with its water feature in fact the reason that it took me an hour to walk from buckingham palace to kensington palace was because i did a pit stop at the diana garden another royal park i went to recently was regent park which has its own zoo and takes you towards primrose hill for some great views out over london if youre prepared to climb it there are others including grwi park which you can do if you want to go to grwi observatory but its up a huge hill so dont say i didnt warn you basically google the parks before you go to london and see whats close to you and to other things youre going to see in all cases though please watch out for the cyclists in these locations unless you are one in which case please watch out for the pedestrians speaking of the observatory that brings us to number the royal observatory at royal museums grwi mixes history and science and is child friendly so this might be a good compromise if you find yourself traveling with people who for some inexplicable reason dont have the same love of history as you and i and want to see some other space stuff instead by the way the astronomy offerings here are actually really good too so it shouldnt be a chore for you to see that stuff as well at this roughly y old site you can among other things stand on the prime meridian line and see the famous octagon room commissioned by charles ii and designed by christopher ren yes the same guy who designed simp hols its not free but its also not one of the more expensive items on this list that honor goes to the likes of big benan buckingham palace and the tour of london your ticket doesnt cover everything available though it doesnt include planetarium showes for instance so do check in advance what the extras are that youll have to pay separately for number the national portrait gallery this is an absolute must for history nerds its free it alles photography and it includes portraits and busts of some of the most famous people in british history and beyond its got a whole gallery on the plantagenets and the tudors which is where i got many of my pictures of them and it runs short talks on a lot of its more famous artworks too i just happened to cross a talk in progress on the portraits of elizabeth the first it has for instance including her famous coronation portrait it is quite big and youre going to need to to ally a minimum of hours i would say though i spent longer there as i was taking so many pictures it took me minutes just to get out of the plantagenet shooter gallery for example its cafe is pretty small be warned with a fairly limited choice but you dont have to eat there if you dont want to when i visited the gallery in the summer it was packed and even though i was in the queue half an hour before opening it was still very busy as soon as i was through the doors when i visited in april it was much quieter and i just walked in in the middle of the day the great thing about the mpg though is that you can do it in conjunction with the attraction which is at number on my list number the national gallery this is right next door to the national portrait gallery literally a second walk around the corner and faces out into trafalga square which you can of course take a look around as well while youre there and see the famous monument in fact you might want to arrive before before either gallery opens and have a look at the square then you may have to queue at the steps of the national gallery to get in but its free to visit and you can happily spend a couple of hours there if not longer its basement cafe is also relatively limited but not too bad the interior of this building upstairs in the main galleries is something else though i shot this footage of the ceiling because its just so stunning really though my camera doesnt do it justice and thats before we get to the art on the walls again there are images of lots of very famous historical figures places and events and notable works of art to lookout out for include the execution of lady jan gray which i did a whole video on hans hbin paintings of christina of milan and the ambassadors the arnoldi portrait and a personal favorite of mine the ugly duchess try to get a map if you can as this place is a bit of a me number q palace this is outside the city center so be prepared for a fairly lengthy chbe ride and its also one of the smaller royal palaces youll visit more of a country home in its day really its where queen charlotte died and in fact i recall seeing the exact chair in which she died during my visit there and while the house tour wont take that long given its size youll definitely want to check out the gardens which include a gorgeous pagoda for this reason you should try to go on a dry day youre also pretty close to heath here so be prepared to see and hear lots of planes flying overhead given how far out of the main city it is i dont think youll do anything else on the day you go here number hampton court palace speaking of day trip venues that brings us to the much more impressive hampton court palace which is again an all day affair and will require some forward planning as youll need to get the tr out to richmond to visit it from the front its a chudar style palace originally built for thomas woolsey and then taken over by henry vii from the side its all stew thanks to the intervention of william iii the inside also includes this mix of architecture and decor youll see the clock court outside and the great hall upon entering with the priceless tudor tapestries on the walls then theres this supposedly haunted gallery where catherine howards ghost apparently rooms sometimes plus some beautiful and world famous artwork on the walls including the famous family of henry vii portrait and the room in which he married catherine parr theres also the chapel where edward vi was christened and bear in mind that no photography is allowed in there although it is all loed elsewhere youll then move forward in time to the stuart and hanovarian eras and see the area of the palace in which they lived with yet more fantastic artwork and historical artifacts the gardens are an absolute mustsee to and include a fantastic fountain and a large restaurant though youll have to walk a little way to get to it not a cheap day out but well worth the money in my opinion number the british museum one of the most famous museums in the world this is free to enter but if youre there in peak season be prepared for monstrous cues i stood for minutes one day in august for example this is impart because there is airport style security to go through before you can enter the museum includes some very famous artifacts such as the rosetta stone and the parthenon marbles though it has taken a reputational bashing recently when it emerged that a no former employee was allegedly stealing and selling objects for years without anyone noticing and i wonder if the parthenon marbles in particular are going to have to be given back to greece at some point as the museum ni struggled to argue that its the best place to care for and protect them only time will tell im not going to say something rather controversial about this attraction which will sound very odd coming from an historian and that is that i dont particularly enjoy the british museum when im there ive been at least twice that i can recall and i just find myself getting a little bit bored i went to see the very famous items ive just mentioned and then wandered into the rest of the building where i find things like rooms of old dishes in glass cases that sort of thing doesnt really interest me though and while they do have a good egyptian display i find a lot of the other displays to be a bit dull i dont remember there being an audio guide and perhaps if there was something like that to take me around the place and draw my attention to particularly fascinating objects and explain their history to me id have gotten more out of my visits it does have a lovely restaurant and shop though so i have to give it that i also think im probably an outlier in finding it a little boring i imagine most other people love it and if youve never been its certainly worth at least one visit number the victoria and albert museum i enjoyed this museum far more than the british museum it has a great mix of items from paintings to clothing to reconstructed rooms and other material objects tudor nerds should look out for the portraits of the likes of henry vii edward vi and an of cleaves which are in here although an of cleaves is a miniature and was presented in a glass case that rendered it basically impossible for me to photograph it which was disappointing entrance is free and the vna has literally the most beautiful cafe i have ever been in in my life its a kind of art deco experience and its just gorgeous the food was really good too if you do visit dont miss it theres also a large and i thought very good shop and you can go outside into the museums central qu yard and admire its impressive architecture from there in nice weather kids will also enjoy splashing around in the water feature ive only been here once but unlike the british museum im chomping at the bit to go back allow two to three hours to feel like youve done this place justice number the natural history museum this is one of the few items on my list which i havent yet been to myself but its very very close to the vna and i think you could do both in a day if you wanted to its free to enter though you can book tickets to allow you to skip some of the cues when you arrive please note that exhibitions are not included in those tickets you will have to pay extra for them as the name suggests this is a very different type of history to everything else im recommending as its primarily the history of the natural world rather than of human beings if dinosaurs are your thing though then this is the place for you people who have been let us know in the comments below what you thought of it but from looking at the website i think its very child friendly which is obviously going to be a big plus for many people number the imperial war museum ive actually talked about two of the imperial war museums already the church hill war rooms and hms belfast but there is another museum in the city which is part of this group though i havent been to it myself and that is the imperial war museum london unlike the other it is free to enter and as its website explains it quote covers all aspects of conflict involving britain its former empire and the commonwealth from the first world war to the present day youll see the machinery of war like tanks and plans for instance photographs of war zones and can read and listen to firsthand testimonies from people who have lived through conflicts including world war ii definitely a mustsee i think think if this is a type of history that interests you and probably worth a try

rome thanks for joining us music music music well marvel at the biggies the forum the colosseum the pantheon and the empires exquisite art well also wander into some of romes oldest and most colorful neighborhoods after visiting some of early christianitys holiest shrines well enjoy a walking tour of some of romes many offbeat churches housing artistic gems rome is the birthplace of the baroque and well see masterpieces by the movements father bernini well cross the border into the vatican and ponder sun beams in saint peters then well dine really well before going local after dark and lacing together some of the eternal citys most romantic night spots well start where it all began in this little valley amongst the fabled seven hills in a nutshell classical rome lasts about a thousand years roughly bc to rome grew for years peaked for years and fell for years the first half was the republic ruled by elected senators the last half was the empire ruled by unelected emperors in its glory days the word rome meant not just the city but what romans considered the entire civilized world everyone was either roman or barbarian people who spoke latin or greek were considered civilized part of the empire everyone else barbarian according to legend rome was founded by two brothers romulus and remus abandoned in the wild and suckled by a shewolf they grew up to establish the city in actuality the first romans mixed and mingled here in the valley between the famous seven hills of rome this became the roman forum music in they tossed out their king and established the relatively democratic roman republic that began perhaps historys greatest success story the rise of rome from the start romans were expert builders and they had a knack for effective government this simple brick building was once richly veneered with marble confronted by a grand portico its the curia the senate met here and set the legal standards that still guide western civilization the reign of julius caesar who ruled around the time of christ marked the turning point between the republic and the empire the republic designed to rule a small citystate found itself trying to rule most of europe something new and stronger was needed caesar established a nononsense more disciplined government became dictator for life and for good measure had a month named in his honor july the powerful elites of the republic found all this change just too radical in an attempt to save the republic and their political power a faction of roman senators assassinated caesar his body was burned on this spot in bc music the citizens of rome gathered here in the heart of the forum to hear mark antony say in shakespeares words friends romans countrymen lend me your ears ive come to bury caesar not to praise him but the republic was finished and rome became the grand capital of a grand empire music the via sacra or sacred way was the main street of ancient rome it stretched from the arch of septimius severus to the arch of titus romes various triumphal arches named after the emperors who built them functioned as public relations tools reliefs decorating the various arches show how war and expansion were the business of state romes thriving economy was fueled by plunder and slaves one in distant wars ancient rome had a population of over a million at its peak and anywhere you dig in the modern city youll find remains of the ancient one largo argentina is a modern transportation hub with traffic roaring all around some of romes oldest temples the capitoline hill which rises majestically from the busy streets has long been the home of romes city government during the renaissance michelangelo designed this regal staircase he gave the square its famously harmonious proportions and its majestic centerpiece an ancient statue of emperor marcus aurelius this is a copy the second century original the greatest equestrian statue of antiquity is showcased in the adjacent capitoline museum this like the other great statues of antiquity is now safely out of the elements the museum helps you imagine life before the fall of rome these reliefs show marcus aurelius performing the various duties of an emperor here as the chief priest or pontiffs maximus he prepares to sacrifice a bull here on the battlefield he grants clemency to vanquished barbarian leaders and this one puts you curbside at a victory parade with the emperor the eisenhower of his day on a chariot winged victory on his shoulder and trumpets proclaiming his glory music the art of imperial rome almost always carried a message this dying gaul a roman copy of a greek original was part of a monument celebrating another victory over the barbarians like any propaganda art battle scenes stoked imperial pride you can wander among heroic statues in grand halls and look into the eyes of longforgotten emperors and the museum also shows a more peaceful and intimate side of roman life here a boy quietly pulls a thorn from his foot at first glance these look like paintings but theyre actually micro mosaics made of thousands of tiny chips this mosaic hung an emperor hadrians villa music romans emulated the high culture of the greeks and when it came to capturing beauty their forte was making excellent copies of greek originals the capitoline venus is one of the truest representations of the concept of feminine beauty from ancient times like so many classical statues this is a year old roman copy of a year old greek original and this statue called the drunken fawn is a playful reminder that a trait of ancient rome that survives to this day is a fondness for good food and fine wine music part of your roman experience regardless of your budget should be experiencing a fine meal and were doing that al fresco on piazza farnesy were starting with a great spread of antipasti prosciutto porcini mushrooms puntarella a local salad and fresh mozzarella as everywhere eat with the season tonight we said bring on whatevers fresh travelers can enjoy better restaurants without going broke by sharing an array of smaller dishes music and now the pasta i often find the antipasti and pasta dishes more varied and interesting than the more expensive sekondi or main courses even in early may its plenty warm to dine outside dinner within splashing distance of a tub from the ancient baths of caracalla caps a perfectly roman day romes a big city too big to walk everywhere take advantage of public transport i like a hotel in a convenient neighborhood near a subway stop romes subway system while not extensive is easy to use from our hotel its a straight shot to the coliseum call a sale thats our stop the coliseum was and still is colossal its the great example of ancient roman engineering it was begun in ad during the reign of emperor vespasian when the empire was nearing its peak using roman pioneered concrete brick and their trademark round arches romans constructed much larger buildings than the greeks but it seems they still respected the fine points of greek culture they decorated their nononsense megastructure with all three greek orders of columns doric ionic and corinthians inside you can almost hear the roar of ancient rome take a moment to imagine the place in action romans filled and emptied the coliseums seats as quickly and efficiently as we do our super stadiums today music applause its built with two theaters facing each other thats what an amphitheater is so twice as many people could enjoy the entertainment canvas awnings were hoisted over the stadium to give protection from the sun these passageways underneath the arena were covered by a wooden floor between acts animals and gladiators were shuffled around out of sight music ancient romans whose taste for violence exceeded even modern americas came to the coliseum to unwind gladiators criminals and wild animals fought to the death providing the public with a festival of gore to celebrate the colosseums grand opening romans were treated to the slaughter of five thousand animals nearby trajans column trumpets the glories of emperor trajan who ruled rome in its heyday this is a textbook example of continuous narration like a yard long scroll it winds all the way to the top the purpose more pr telling the story of yet another military victory trajan extended the boundaries of the empire to its greatest size ever from the nile to the north of britain controlling its entire coastline romans called the mediterranean simply mari nostrum our sea downtown rome is a kind of architectural time warp youll see almost nothing built post world war ii a striking exception is this contemporary building showcasing the our apaches this altar of peace offers a stirring glimpse at the pride and power of the roman empire at its peak nine years before christ emperor augustus led a procession of priests up these steps to the newly built altar of peace they sacrificed an animal on the top and thanked the gods the last of the serious barbarian resistance had been quilled and now there could be peace the empire was established and this marked the start of the pax romana music the pax romana or roman peace was a golden age of good living relative stability and military dominance that lasted from the time of christ for about two centuries music the altars exquisite reliefs celebrate romes success and prosperity this goddess of fertility is surrounded by symbols of abundance and this procession shows a populace thankful for its emperor the stability and relative prosperity that characterized the two centuries of the roman peace was due in part to a steady succession of capable rulers music as visitors its our challenge to appreciate the grandeur of this incredible city built on the scale of giants for instance when rome went to the races it came here the circus maximus imagine a quarter of a million romans cheering on careening chariots and overlooking it all the palatine hill filled with towering palaces and a visit to the national museum at the palazzo massimo helps humanize the empire while ancient romes architecture was monumental its citizens were just people like you and me without electricity these frescoes a rare surviving example of roman painting bring color to our image of daily life back then music romans like to think of themselves as somehow living parallel with the gods these domestic scenes come with a twist of mythology and this painted garden wallpapering a roman villa showed an appreciation for nature while creating an atmosphere of serenity admiring the artifacts of romes elite from exquisite jewelry to this delicate golden hairnet we can only marvel at lifestyles of the rich and roman music many aspects of roman life are represented roman artists excelled in realism this boxer is a picture of exhaustion with a roughed up face and tired hands complete with brass knuckles the museums collection tells the empires story through art caesar augustus was the nephew of julius caesar and the first great emperor of the pax romana looking into the eyes of the man who called himself the first among equals you get the feeling that the ship of state was in good hands but by the time this statue was carved its clear the pox romana was finished and rome was falling this boy is about to become head of state it was a chaotic and unstable time in fact in the rd century emperors were assassinated in a year period surrounded by nervous senators this child emperor is no picture of confidence music throughout the ages people mined once glorious buildings as quarries imagine they were stacked with precut stones free for the taking block by block they carted away most of this temple and then incorporated what was still standing like these columns into a modern building thankfully no one cannibalized the magnificent pantheon the best preserved temple from ancient rome the portico with its stately pediment has symbolized roman greatness ever since antiquity like the obelisks its massive onepiece granite columns were shipped from egypt theyre huge it takes four tourists to hug one step inside to enjoy the finest look anywhere at the splendor of ancient rome its dimensions are classic based on a perfect circle as wide as it is tall feet the oculus is the only source of light the pantheon survived so well because its been in continuous use for over years it went almost directly from being a pagan temple to being a christian church the beauty of the pantheon and the brilliance of its construction has inspired architects through the ages the dome is made of poured concrete which gets thinner and lighter with height the highest part is made with pumice and every volcanic stone pantheon means all the gods it was a spiritual menagerie where the many gods of the empire were worshiped music there was a kind of religious freedom back then if you were conquered youre welcome to keep your own gods as long as you worship caesar too this was generally no problem but the christians who had a single and very jealous god were the exception because they refused to worship the emperor early christians were persecuted for a little early christian history were heading outside the city for a look at the catacombs romes ancient wall stretches miles it protected the city until italy was united in music from gates like this grand roads fanned out to connect the city with its empire the appian way romes gateway to the east is fun to explore on a rented bike it was the grandest and fastest road yet the wonder of its day very straight as roman engineers were fond of designing it stretched miles to naples and then onto brindisi from where roman ships sailed to greece and egypt these are the original stones music tombs of ancient big shots lined the appian way like billboards while pagans didnt enjoy the promise of salvation those who could afford it purchased a kind of immortality by building themselves big and glitzy memorials these line the main roads out of town judging by their elegant togas these brothers were from a fine family this is the mausoleum of chichilya matala whose fatherinlaw was extremely wealthy while it dates from the first century bc we still remember her to this day so apparently the investment paid off but of course early christians didnt have that kind of money so they buried their dead in mass underground necropolis or catacombs dug beneath the property of the few fellow christians who did own land these catacombs are scattered all around the city just outside the walls and several are open to the public music the tomb line tunnels of the catacombs stretch for miles and are many layers deep many of the first christians buried here were later recognized as martyrs and saints others then carved out niches nearby to bury their loved ones close to these early christian heroes music by the middle ages the catacombs were abandoned and forgotten centuries later they were rediscovered romantic age tourists on the grand tour visited by candlelight and legends grew about christians hiding out to escape persecution but the catacombs were not hideouts they were simply budget underground cemeteries music further along the appian way is romes aqueduct park offering a chance to see how the ancient city got its water with its million people rome needed lots of water these ingenious aqueducts carried a steady stream from distant mountains into the city and they still seem to gallop as they did two thousand years ago into rome these aqueducts were the achilles heel of rome if you wanted to bring down the city all you had to do is take down one of the arches in fact in the sixth century the barbarians did just that without water rome basically shriveled up today the parks a favorite with locals for walking the dog or burning off some of that pasta music with its imperial might and those stories about persecutions and hungry lines in the coliseum its easy to forget that the last century of the roman empire was christian in the general constantine following a vision that he would triumph under the sign of the cross beat his rival maxentius taking power emperor constantine then legalized christianity this obscure outlawed jewish sect ultimately became the religion of the empire music in the year you could be killed for being a christian in the year you could be killed for not being a christian church attendance boomed an emperor constantine built the first great christian church right here san giovanni in la torano saint johns it opened as a kind of first vatican saint johns which has been rebuilt over the ages was the original home of the bishop of rome or pope high atop the canopy over the altar a box supposedly contains bits of the skulls of saint peter and saint paul the church is filled with symbols of christianitys triumph over pagan rome for instance tradition says these gilded bronze columns once stood in pagan romes holiest temple and what better doors for this first grand church than those which once hung in ancient romes senate house the adjacent holy stairs are a major stop on romes pilgrimage trail many credit emperor constantines mother saint helena for her sons conversion she brought home wagon modes of relics including these stairs believed to be from the palace of pontius pilate for years pilgrims believing jesus climbed to these stairs on the day he was condemned have scaled the scala santa on their knees music the importance of rome is due in part to its location the city was born about years ago here along the tiber river this was as far upstream as boats could sail and the first place the river could be crossed by bridge as a center of river trade rome connected the interior of the italian peninsula with the mediterranean this riverbank would have been bustling in ancient times imagine busy docks ramshackle boats water mills and platforms for fishing until modern times romes river was part of its economy then in the s in order to protect the city from flooding the romans walled off the tiber they built these tall anonymous embankments that continue to isolate the river from the city to this day while rome was born on the tiber today the town seems to ignore its river but the citys graceful bridges connect thriving neighborhoods just over the tiber from here is one of romes most colorful districts trast havery is the place to immerse yourself in the crestier side of rome the name trestavory actually means across the tiber river wandering here offers a chance to hone your senses to see rome more intimately youll discover a world of artisans who found their niche and love it the people here trust tavorini are proud oldtimers once bragged of never setting foot on the opposite side of the river as we explore and observe the big city seems worlds away for maximum trestavory fun and insight im joined by my friend and roman tour guide francesca caruso especially here in trestavor you get this sense of the many layers of rome certainly that is really the key to understanding world this city and its almost years of history was never abandoned so people have just built on top and around the what was already there like a layer cake isnt it wait theres a beautiful roof garden yeah most of us in realm live in apartments so no gardens no backyards so we all dream of the article music an adequate with the terrace yes so the skyline of rome is full of these little jungles on the rooftops everythings so intimate its like its like were walking through somebodys laundry room weve always lived very close together here sharing space is really not a problem we dont even have the word for privacy in italian we use the english word instead we simply roll the r so we say privacy privacy i know one more italian word music now so why are so many of the oldest churches in rome on this side of the river because they say that it was the neighborhood of the foreigners often christian who brought their faith with them for the whole period of the persecutions they could not build churches so mass would be celebrated in the homes of wealthy comforts who offered their homes for mass so then this is one of those kind of churches yes it was the house of chichilia and in later times they built a church dedicated to her and today the name of the church is now what happened to saint cecilia saint cecilia and her husband were killed because of their faith the romans tried to steam her to death for three days in her own home and after that they beheaded her this is a beautiful statue its just peaceful yes its very quiet theres something very tender about it and also very sad about a young woman who was killed so brutally for her faith music fronting another early christian church santa maria in trasthavery is an inviting piazza the concept of a piazza serving as a community center goes back to ancient times piazza santamarian trust havery still functions as the beating heart of this neighborhood great part of exploring a neighborhood is just sitting on the main square yeah i think its really in our dna weve been living in our piazzas as common living rooms since ancient roman times its always been this way and lets hope it will always be this way in the future too for dinner were venturing into a different neighborhood one of my favorite restaurants is a short cab ride away back on the other side of the river ristarante el gabriello provides a peaceful and local feeling respite from the intensity of the big city claudio serves with charisma while his brother gabriella cooks roman cuisine with a creative twist using fresh organic products from the market and from his wifes farm sometimes italians like to ignore the menu just trust the restaurateur and go with the meal he suggests whenever possible so do i and thats the plan tonight first up fresh scampi oysters and shrimp and theyre served the way romans like it crudo or raw oh yes thats nice next claudio switches us from a white to a red wine in anticipation of the pasta dishes music okay first a ravioli with a delicate cream sauce and a pinch of sage thats a nice leadin to our second pasta spaghetti a la carbonara carbonara is eggs pancetta some pecorino and a little bit of parmigiano and pepper very simple and very roman claudio recommends a wine change to a super tuscan super super this will be super with a dish of rare beef topped with thin strips of lard as an extra treat hes prepared a special local white fish and finally the dolce sorry but these desserts taste even better than they look what a meal while much of rome is splendid in grandiose it can be intimate as well regardless of your sightseeing agenda getting out early lets you enjoy some of the worlds great public spaces while theyre just waking up early birds can even enjoy the generally packed pantheon nearly all to themselves a morning spent wandering is filled with surprises playful fountains decorate squares poke around explore in the back streets its clear this city is a collection of real neighborhoods artfully living well in a rustic and ancient shell as the rhythm of daily life hits its stride the famous spanish steps today adorned with azaleas fill with people for over years romantics have gathered here to enjoy a little dolce vita with their sightseeing and it remains a popular place to savor the joy of simply being in rome another characteristic and interesting old neighborhood and a delight to explore is the ghetto or jewish quarter in ancient times this bridge was called jews bridge because jews and other foreigners who werent allowed to live in central rome would commute from trust havery over there across this bridge to get into town to understand the jewish chapter of romes story were joining my friend and fellow tour guide michaela pavanchello michaelas family goes all the way back to the jewish community living here before christ and the family line continues her babys do in just a few months so whats unique about the roman jewish community well first of all were not ashkenazim and were not safari you know the ashkenazi went to germany and poland and the safari went to spain okay the roman jews came straight from jerusalem before the destruction of the temple so we are here since before the diaspora ah so when you think askah naji are sephardic thats after the dinosaur yeah but you could say this is the oldest jewish community in europe yes one of the oldest outside of israel so if the roman jews came before the diaspora why did they come here in the first place because they were diplomats and businessmen and during the centuries we had to live with emperors and popes and we were tolerated because we were good for the business and we were not pushing our religions to the others and we were keeping it for ourselves so then what happened then were in the reformation came and the church had to fight any alternative religion and so the ghetto was established in rome to okay so the church is fighting the protestants and at the same time fighting the jews yeah and to avoid any contamination between jews and christians jews were segregated in that walled area in rome in so what was the life like in the ghetto well you have to imagine people squeezing a four blocks area flooded every single winter because the tiber would flood every winter so it was quality muddy disgusting it was the worst real estate of rome the synagogue was the community center it looks like a church because back when it was built there were no jewish architects handy and thats what christian builders knew how to make its art nouveau with a dash of tiffany the dome was painted with the colors of the rainbow symbolic of gods promise to noah that there would be no more floods the stars symbolized that the jewish people would be as many as the stars in the sky back in previous centuries when the ghetto was a walled in town christian romans built churches at each gate and each of these churches came complete with an attempt in hebrew script to convert the jews music while most of the squalid ghetto was demolished with italian unification in the buildings facing the main drag survive shops sell fine locally produced judaica and kosher restaurants proudly serve traditional dishes like those with artichokes while the jewish community now lives all over town many roman jews still enjoy gathering here in the neighborhood where they have such deep roots so ill take you to the jewish bakery the same family has been running the same business for years he only offered five or six recipes so dont ask for weird things did he only have cheesecake with chocolate yeah cinnamon biscuit with almonds macaroons and the pizza thats called the jewish pizza whats in the jewish pizza its like a almost like a fruitcake with pineapples almonds candies tell me about the haliburton uh the jala bread uh its um its what we serve when a baby boy is born or when a couple gets married or when we have a bar mitzvah music so this is to celebrate a new baby yeah its to celebrate new babies its very appropriate today very nice rome is a city of magnificent art its everywhere you look and most of it was paid for by the church public squares like piazza navona with berninis much loved four rivers fountain are decorated with churchsponsored art until modern times it was the church that had the power the money and the need for great art and going to church offered the masses whose lives were so dreary otherwise a promising glimpse of the glory that awaited them in the next life the importance of the church in rome is obvious around every corner there seems to be another little nondescript church hiding sumptuous art treasures the wonderful thing about seeing art in churches is that its in situ not hanging on museum walls but exactly where the art was designed to be enjoyed these churches span many different eras byzantine medieval renaissance baroque and beyond thoughtfully stringing together a series of lesserknown churches can be an art lovers delight when visiting historic churches like santa maria sopra minerva our challenge is to appreciate the art with the mindset of a medieval churchgoer here we find a glorious gothic interior laden with great art the altar sits upon the tomb of saint catherine with the ornate tombs of two medici popes looking down for generations pilgrims have marveled at this michelangelo statue of christ carrying the cross and in the side chapel is a lovely series of frescoes by felipe lippy showing the good works of saint thomas aquinas accompanied by a celestial serenade and popping into one of romes many baroque churches you hardly know where to look every inch is slathered with ornamentation oh wow spiral columns framing scenes that almost come to life cupids doing flipflops and ceilings opening up into the heavens after the intellectual nature of the renaissance baroque which followed was emotional by the year renaissance artists had mastered realism now in baroque went beyond realism to wow its viewers with exuberance baroque art was propaganda it served the needs of the divine monarchs and of the church by pulling emotional strings it convinced people to obey rome is the birthplace of the baroque style and gian lorenzo bernini who lived and worked here in the th century is considered its father seemingly insignificant churches like santa maria delevitoria come with lavish interiors and if you know where to look important baroque treasures hide out bernini designed this side chapel like a theater with members of the family who paid for the art looking on from their box seats the master bernini invigorates reality with emotion center stage is the ecstasy of saint teresa bernini captures the feeling teresa described when the angel pierced her heart with a heavenly arrow she said the pain was so sharp that i cried aloud but at the same time i experienced such delight that i wished it would last forever music for a break from all that art head to campo de fiori literally the field of flowers this has long been a fragrant and vibrant market the market thrives in the morning whats seasonal during your visit will be favored by local chefs and featured on their daily menus were here in may and its puntarella asparagus and artichokes whether you come for the produce or just for a stroll campodifiori is one of romes beloved public spaces music rome is notorious for noisy traffic and until recently that plagued many of romes fine public spaces but the notorious roman traffic is being tamed like cities all over europe more and more of its old center has become traffic free and pedestrian friendly still watch out for the scooters after years of searching out my favorite european restaurants i found a few universal indicators for a great eating value and a place like this has them all the best eateries are little family run places that cater to locals this ones open weekday lunches only at a glance you know this place is really a find limited selection handwritten menu in one language packed with the neighborhood gang each day theres a special today at spaghetti carbonara simple tasty cucina cassalinga thats home cooking roman style music for a breezy escape from the big city noise and intensity head for the borghese gardens romes central park romans are proud of their generous green spaces this sprawling park has long offered people here a place to relax unwind and let the kids run wild the park centerpiece is the borghese gallery once a cardinals lavish mansion today it welcomes the public as is the case with many of europes top sites admission requires a reservation getting ones easy just a quick phone call or visit the website and you get an entry time good guide books have all the details applause the wealthy borghese family filled their th century villa with art this was the age when the rich and powerful not only collected beautiful art but actually employed leading artists to spiff up their homes cardinal borghese was the popes nephew and one of the wealthiest people in rome with unlimited money his palace dazzled with both fine art of the past such as raphaels exquisite deposition and with the best start of the day each room has a masterpiece at its center like this intriguing loo
